L. Turner (Asteraceae) (Hs) are endangered and poorly studied plant species; related plants have been used against chronic-degenerative and infectious diseases. Therefore, Hv and Hs could be sources of bioactive compounds against these illnesses. Objective: To determine the chemical composition and biological activities (antioxidant, antimutagenic and antimicrobial) of Hv and Hs leaves (L) and stems (S). Materials and methods: Methanol extracts (ME) of each plant/tissue were evaluated for their phytochemicals; phenolics (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS); antioxidant activity (AA) (0.125-4 mg/mL) (DPPH, ABTS, ORAC and beta-carotene discoloration); antimutagenicity (0.5 and 1mg/plate) (Ames assay, tester strain Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium YG1024, 1-nitropyrene as mutagen); activity against human pathogens (1mg/mL); and toxicity (0.01-2 mg/mL) (Artemia salina assay). Results: All ME showed flavonoids and triterpenes/steroids. The ME-SHv had the highest content of total phenolics (TP) (2245.82 +/- 21.45mg GAE/100 g d.w.) and condensed tannins (603.71 +/- 1.115mg CE/100 g d. w.). The compounds identified were flavonoids (kaempferol 7-O-coumaroylhexoside, and two kaempferol 7-O-rhamnosylhexosides) and phenolics [rosmarinic acid, and 3'-O-(8 ''-Z-caffeoyl) rosmarinic acid]. The ME-LHs showed the highest content of flavonoids (357.88mg RE/g d. w.) and phenolic acids (238.58mg CAE/g d. w.) by HPLC. The ME-SHv showed the highest AA. All ME were strong antimutagens (63.3-85.7%). Only the Hs extracts were toxic (ME-LHs, LC50 = 94.9 +/- 1.7 mu g/mL; ME-SHs, LC50 = 89.03 +/- 4.42 mu g/mL).

(granadilla) residues (peel, seed and mixed peel, seed) were initially evaluated for antimicrobial potential against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. Notably, 80% acetone granadilla seed extract showed inhibitory activity against major bacteria (five) compared to the other extracts. Next, the extraction conditions of this extract were optimised, varying the solid/solvent ratio (0.5: 10-6.0: 10), incubation time (10-60 min) and temperature (30-60 degrees C), to obtain maximum antimicrobial activity, total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). A central composite rotatable design (2(3) factorial arrangement with six axial points and three central points) was used. The temperature and solid/solvent ratio were most significant parameters to obtain extracts with antibacterial potential and significant bioactive compounds content (TPC and TFC). The response surfaces indicated that extracts obtained with increased solid/solvent molar ratio and temperature possess maximum inhibitory potential against most of the tested bacteria. However, extracts obtained with decreased molar ratio and increased temperature will have maximum TPC and TFC, respectively.

Besides their role in the phytoremediation of pollutants, the cultivated plants, if properly selected, can also produce a range of bioactive compounds, including those with potential inhibitory effects against pathogenic bacteria. Bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids and ellagitannins, known for their remarkable antimicrobial properties, offer a sustainable solution to the global challenge of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we investigated macrophyte species adapted to the water variations in the Pantanal region (flood and dry seasons), focusing on those with both antimicrobial and ornamental potential, that could improve the ability of a CW system to treat greywater. Seven different macrophyte species were collected, cultivated, and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity (AA) against five standard bacterial strains and five multidrug-resistant clinical bacterial strains. Extracts from the leaf, stem, and root of Polygonum acuminatum showed the best AA against clinical multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Escherichia coli, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 78.13 to 312.5 mu g.mL-1. Furthermore, the leaves of Ludwigia lagunae and P. acuminatum also showed considerable AA against standard strains of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC = 19.5 and 39.06 mu g.mL-1, respectively) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 156.25 mu g. mL-1 for both). High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Ultraviolet and Mass Spectrometry analysis of these extracts identified important bioactive compounds, including flavonoids (quercetin 3-rhamnoside, hydropiperoside, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, quercetin, myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside, formononetin, and calycosin) and ellagitannins (3,3 ' 4-tri-O-methylelagic acid, galloys-HHDP-glucose, and ellagic acid), along with other bioactive compounds.

Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTSPetals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH center dot). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC50 1.33-0.08mgmg(-1) DPPH center dot) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified.

In addition, the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties were investigated using in vitro assays. Crude yield was highest for the water extract (5.78 g/ 100 g DW) and decreased with increased ethanol. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were highest in the 75 % ethanol extract (26.95 mg GAE/g crude and 23.73 mg QE/g crude, respectively). GC-MS analysis of the 75 % ethanol extract revealed 33 bioactive compounds, accounting for 96.33 % of the total area. Significant components included benzene, 1,4-bis(phenylmethyl)- (15.05 %), and naphthalene, 1,6-dimethyl- (10.98 %); also present were sterols, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, aromatic, and heterocyclic compounds, indicating a complex chemical profile. In antioxidant assays, the 75 % ethanol extract revealed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50: 143.03 mg/L), reducing power (IC50: 378.69 mg/L), and lipid peroxidation (IC50: 526.25 mg/L). However, the absolute ethanol extract exhibited both the highest metal chelating activity (IC50: 382.60 mg/L) and the strongest antimicrobial activity, inhibiting all 11 tested foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.

The therapeutic effects in the plants are due to the chemical compounds therein. Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. of the family Poaceae is a perennial, pan-tropical species of grass which is a well-known traditional medicine and has a renowned position for treatment of many symptoms and diseases. The chemical composition, free radical scavenging activity, and antimicrobial properties of the methanolic extract of C. dactylon rhizomes against selected bacterial and fungal strains were investigated using disk-diffusion method. The results indicated that the major fatty acid structures of C. dactylon methanolic extract were palmitic acid (36.40%), oleic acid (28.26%), and linoleic acid (17.01%). Alpha-tocopherol (151.39 mg center dot kg(-1)) and sitosterol (3199.62 mg center dot kg(-1)) were the main tocopherols and sterols, respectively. According to the instrumental analysis, the total phenolic compounds of methanolic extract were equal to 917.08 mg center dot kg(-1) and the main compound was hydroquinone (66.89%). Antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract at concentrations of 100-1000 ppm was 9.81-67.87%, which is significantly different from the 200 ppm synthetic antioxidant (BHT) with free radical scavenging activity equal to 48.93% (p<0.05). The antimicrobial study revealed that the methanolic extract of C. dactylon rhizomes was effective against all of the bacterial pathogens and the antibacterial activity increased with an increase in the concentration of extract. Therefore, the largest zone of inhibition was observed against Bacillus cereus (18.3 +/- 0.4 mm) and Escherichia coli (16.8 +/- 0.5 mm) at 1000 ppm. The highest resistance was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (inhibition zone of 12.8 +/- 0.15 mm). Methanolic extract at 200 ppm had no effect against fungus Aspergillus niger.

The extract obtained at 90 degrees C exhibited the highest phenolic content and antiradical activity. Therefore, this extract was analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC-MS, which allowed the identification of 46 compounds, being quercetin and chlorogenic acid derivatives representative of 86% of the total of phenolic compounds identified in hydrophilic fraction of the aqueous extract. Naringenin (27.2%) was the major compound present in the lipophilic fraction. The antiproliferative effects of the S. nigra extract were evaluated using the colon cancer cell lines RKO, HCT-116, Caco-2 and the extract's antigenotoxic potential was evaluated by the Comet assay in RKO cells. The RKO cells were the most susceptible to S. nigra flower extract (IC50 = 1250 mu g mL(-1)). Moreover, the extract showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis.

The perennial plant Hypericum perforatum is widely distributed around the world. It has been used for many years in conventional medicine to treat a variety of illnesses, including stress, mild to moderate depression, and minor injuries. This study examined the antimicrobial activity of the H. perforatum total extract and its fractions (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and aqueous) against multi-drug-resistant (MDR) isolates that were gathered from clinical samples, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia. Materials and Methods. Aerial parts of H. perforatum were collected and extracted using various solvents and were tested versus different isolated bacterial species. The inhibition zone of tested extracts was detected using an agar diffusion assay, and MICs were measured. Phytochemical analysis of promising H. perforatum extract was done using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Ultrastructure examination for the most altered bacteria used transmission electron microscopy. Antioxidant assays were done using DPPH and ABTS scavenging capacity methods. Cytotoxicity was reported versus Vero cells. Results. Different extracts of H. perforatum showed promising antibacterial activity against the pathogens. While the subfractions of the total extract were observed to show lesser inhibition zones and higher MIC values than the total extract of H. perforatum against MDR strains, the total extract of H. perforatum demonstrated the most potent antimicrobial action with an inhibition zone range of 17.9-27.9 mm. MDR-K. pneumoniae was discovered to be the most susceptible strain, which is consistent with the antibacterial inhibitory action of H. perforatum whole extract. Additionally, after treatment at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC 3.9 mu g/ml), the transmission electron microscope showed alterations in the ultrastructure of the K. pneumoniae cells. Methanol extract from H. perforatum has a CC50 value of 976.75 mu g/ml. Conclusion. Future inhibitors that target MDR strains may be revealed by these findings.

In particular, industrial by-products such as mango peels are sustainable sources of bioactive substances, with antioxidant, enzymatic, and antimicrobial activity. Appropriate processing is essential to obtain highly bioactive compounds for further use in generating value-added products for the food industry. The objective of the study was to investigate and compare the biological activity of compounds from fresh and dried mango peels obtained by different conventional methods and unconventional extraction methods using supercritical fluids (SFE). The highest total phenolic content (25.0 mg GAE/g DW) and the total content of eight phenolic compounds (829.92 mu g/g DW) determined by LC-MS/MS were detected in dried mango peel extract obtained by the Soxhlet process (SE). SFE gave the highest content of proanthocyanidins (0.4 mg PAC/g DW). The ethanolic ultrasonic process (UAE) provided the highest antioxidant activity of the product (82.4%) using DPPH radical scavenging activity and total protein content (2.95 mg protein/g DW). Overall, the dried mango peels were richer in bioactive compounds (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, catechin, and hesperidin/neohesperidin), indicating successful preservation during air drying. Furthermore, outstanding polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipase activities were detected in mango peel extracts. This is the first study in which remarkable antibacterial activities against the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) were evaluated by determining the microbial growth inhibition rate after 12 and 24 h incubation periods for mango peel extracts obtained by different methods.

Qualitative phytochemical analysis result confirmed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoid, steroids, saponins and glycosides as chemical constituents in P. tectorius fruits extract. It was supported by high TPC content in this extracts. The ethyl acetate extract from cores part (PEC) showed the highest antioxidant capacity (IC50 = 0.8 +/- 0.20 mg/mL), while ethyl acetate extract from keys part (PEK) displayed highest antibacterial activity with inhibition zone of 10-15 mm, but less strong inhibition as compared to the investigated commercial antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, gentamycin, and tetracycline). Antibacterial kinetic study was further proven that PEK has good antibacterial activity. Moreover, cytotoxicity study revealed that all of extracts did not have any cytotoxic activity against all selected cell lines (IC50 value > 30 mu g/mL). Result founded that both keys and core parts of P. tectorius fruits were found to be rich by phenolics content and potent as antioxidant and antibacterial agents.

Results based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the samples were divided into two main clusters, one associated with roots and the other associated with the aerial parts. Analysis of the bioactive chemical contents revealed that coumarin was the most abundant compound in leaves (0.53 to 0.82%), while osthole and isoimperatorin exhibited relatively high concentrations in roots. Two-year growth samples, which correspond with the harvest period of L. buchtormensis, contained the highest amounts of total coumarin, osthole, and isoimperatorin. Broth microdilution tests showed that Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae) were more sensitive to L. buchtormensis extracts than the Gram-negative bacterial strain (Escherichia coli).

The current study was conducted in order to evaluate in vitro the phytochemical profile and antibacterial activity of Algerian palm dates Phoenix dactylifera L. Materials and methods. Qualitative and quantitative (total polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant activity) phytochemical analysis were performed on aqueous and methanolic extracts of seven varieties of dates as the evaluation of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 strains. Results and discussion. Phytochemical screening of aqueous and methanolic extracts showed the presence of several families of chemical compounds such as catechin tannins, saponins and terpenoids in the seven varieties of dates. The screening of these extracts reveals slight qualitative differences with a greater presence of saponins in the aqueous extract while terpenoids are present in large quantity in the methanolic extract. A quantitative characterization of extracts showed significantly high levels (P<0.05) in the methanolic extract from: 85.8 +/- 0.8 to 275 +/- 0.07 GAE/100g, 36.9 +/- 0.3 to 70.1 +/- 0.9 QE/100g and 18.5 +/- 0.9 to 58.5 +/- 0.5% vs. 66.1 +/- 0.2 to 189 +/- 0.09 GAE/100g, 29.1 +/- 0.5 to 50.8 +/- 0.6 QE/100g and 14.7 +/- 0.4 to 41 +/- 0.1% in aqueous extracts for total polyphenols, flavonoids and reducing power respectively. The susceptibility of bacterial species to various extracts of Phoenix dactylifera L. fruits by agar well diffusion assay showed a maximum inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 43.0 +/- 1.0 and 26.3 +/- 1.5 mm for the methanolic extract of the variety Tamesrit against S. aureus and E. coli strains respectively.

However, little scientific evidence has been found to support this. In this research, the antibacterial activities of Castanopsis lamontii water extract (CLE) were assessed using the micro-dilution method. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of CLE were investigated in RAW264.7 cells. Key bioactive compounds in CLE were also explored. Results showed that CLE was capable of inhibiting the periodontitis pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and the pharyngitis pathogen -hemolytic Streptococcus. It suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells via inactivating the TLR4/NF-B pathway. Besides, it reduced oxidative stress-induced cell injury via scavenging reactive oxygen species. Chemical composition analysis revealed that CLE was rich in epicatechin and procyanidin B2. Further studies confirmed that epicatechin predominantly contributed to the antibacterial activities of CLE, while procyanidin B2 was mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory activities of CLE. Both compounds contributed to the antioxidant activities of CLE. Acute oral toxicity tests proved that CLE was practically non-toxic.

Objectives: The aerial part extracts of Eremostachys azerbaijanica were investigated for their general toxicity, antibacterial and antiproliferative activities. Moreover, preliminary phytochemical investigations were carried out on the extracts. Methods: Brine shrimp lethality test was performed to evaluate general toxicity. Anti-proliferative and anti-bacterial activities were evaluated by (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and disc diffusion methods. Additionally, all the extracts were tested for the presence of various phytoconstituents by different reagents. Results: In our research, the n-Hexane extract situated the greatest active part in the brine shrimp lethality test, whereas methanol (MeOH) extract didn't show substantial effect. MTT assay was carried out on one normal cell line and 2 cancer cell lines including the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), the human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29), and the human lung carcinoma (A549), respectively. The end results indicated that the n-Hexane and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts possessed potent anti-proliferative effects against HT29 and A549 cell lines. Interestingly, none of these 3 extracts showed any important effect against HUVEC cells. As a final point, these 3 extracts didn't have any antimicrobial activities against gram positive, gram negative, and Candida albicans species. Conclusions: n-Hexane extract had the maximum cytotoxicity against Artemia salina and A549 cells, whereas DCM extract was the most potent fraction against HT29 cell line.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of A. unedo leaf extracts on 15 uropathogens and test the extent to which arbutin, as the most abundant bioactive compound in the leaves, is responsible for their antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity of leaf extracts against urinary pathogenic microorganisms was tested by agar well diffusion assay and twofolded microdilution method. Since the polyphenolic content responsible for A. unedo leaves' antimicrobial activity depends on climate and geolocation, the authors determined the total phenolic, tannin, flavonoid and phenolic acid content using spectrophotometric methods, arbutin and hydroquinone mass fraction using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and antioxidative activities by FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH assay. Although methanol was shown to be a more effective solvent for the extraction of polyphenols from leaves, the traditionally used aqueous extract exhibited similar antimicrobial properties. While arbutin did not show direct antimicrobial activity, its metabolite hydroquinone showed strong antimicrobial activity against the tested uropathogens. The strongest antimicrobial activity of leaf extracts was detected for uropathogenic strains of Enterococcus faecalis, which was probably associated with the ability of bacterial beta-glucosidase, exerting strong activity in E. faecalis, to convert arbutin to hydroquinone. Our study suggested that the aqueous extract of strawberry tree leaves has the potential for use as a phytotherapeutic in clinical application and should be further investigated.

This waste is rich in bioactive compounds; therefore, it can be valorised by extracting their compounds of biological interest and incorporating them into cosmetic products. In this work, an extract was obtained from kiwi peels and characterised regarding its biological properties and phenolic composition. Results demonstrated that the extract presented antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS radicals (IC50 values of 244 mg/L and 58 mg/L, respectively) and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Catechin and epicatechin (flavonoids), as well as chlorogenic acid (phenolic acid), were the main phenolic compounds identified. Subsequently, the kiwi peel extract was incorporated into cosmetic formulations and their antioxidant properties and stability were evaluated. An increase in the antioxidant activity of the moisturising cream was observed upon the extract's addition. Also, no microorganisms were present in any formulation prepared, attesting to their microbial safety. Finally, the results from the stability analysis revealed that the moisturising creams remained relatively stable for two weeks.

P. guajava leaves were extracted using methanol -chloroform (1:1). Phytochemical analysis of P. guajava leaves extract (PGLE) was performed using total phenolic content (TPC) assay, total flavonoid content (TFC) assays, and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In vitro, antioxidant potential (DPPH radical scavenging assay, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assay, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay), antibacterial activity (broth microdilution method), and hemolytic analysis of PGLE were performed. In vivo, wound healing proficiency of PGLE (10, 5, and 2.5% w/w) was determined by estimating hydroxyproline and endogenous antioxidant markers. TPC and TFC were found to be 57.5 +/- 0.37 mu g gallic acid equivalent/mg extract and 32.1 +/- 0.24 mu g quercetin equivalent/mg extract, respectively. A prominent concentration of polyphenols was demonstrated by HPLC-based quantification with the highest value of rutin which is 12.3 +/- 0.12 mu g/mg extract. A noteworthy DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC50 of 40.7 mu g/ml, TAC, and FRAP i.e., 159.3 +/- 0.11 and 206.1 +/- 0.17 mu g ascorbic acid equivalent/mg extract, respectively were exhibited by PGLE. Significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentration of 250, 400, 400, and 500 mu g/ml respectively was depicted by PGLE and found biocompatible with 1.1 +/- 0.16% hemolysis. Significant wound contraction, faster epithelialization (9 +/- 1 days), extensive fibroblast proliferation, and substantial neovascularization were observed in the 10% PGLE-treated group also evident by histopathological examination. Significant hydroxyproline (15.7 +/- 1.02 mu g/mg tissue), catalase, peroxidase (5.4 +/- 0.26 and 6.1 +/- 0.35 U/mg tissue) and glutathione content (9.7 +/- 0.06 mmol/mg tissue) with p -value of less than 0.01 was demonstrated by 10% PGLE. A reduction in lipid peroxidation (0.5 +/- 0.07 mmol/mg tissue) was also observed at the same concentration (10%).

They were rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The predominant carotenoid was zeaxanthin (13.15 mg/kg) for SCSO and beta-carotene (33.45 mg/kg) for PSO. Naringenin, ellagic acid, resveratrol, kaempferol, catechin, and gallic acid were found to be the major secondary metabolites in the samples by LC/MS-MS. Further analysis of phenolic compounds and fatty acids were conducted by using C-13 and H-1 NMR. Functional groups of the oils were analyzed by FT-IR spectra. DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC assays were used to investigate the antioxidant activity. The alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of SCSO and PSO was 4.38 and 5.16 mg/ml, respectively. SCSO exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus although the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was inhibited by the PSO. Practical applications There is remarkable demand for cold-pressed seed oils instead of other oils in western countries, recently. The results showed that sour cherry seed oil and pomegranate seed oil have the potential to improve the nutritional value of food and/or pharmaceutical materials thanks to their natural bioactive compounds, especially UFAs.

Chaptalia nutans (L.) Pol. (family: Asteraceae) is widely used in traditional medicine as laxative and anticough medications and especially in the traumatisms, wounds, and hemorrhages in topical preparations. Objective. This work was to evaluate the chemical constitution of the hydromethanolic (30/70 methanol-water) macerating extract obtained from the leaves of C. nutans, as well as to study the antioxidant, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and genotoxic activity of the species. Materials and methods. Phytochemical screening, antioxidant activity (total phenolic, total flavonoid, condensed tannins content, DPPH radical, and FRAP), antibacterial activity (P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. epidermidis, E. coli, S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. mirabilis, Candida glabrata (clinical isolate), Candida tropicalis (clinical isolate), C. krusei (clinical isolate), and C. albicans (clinical isolate)), and oxidative stress parameters (TBARS, carbonyl protein, and DCFH) were analyzed according to the literature. Toxicity of C. nutans was evaluated using an alternative method, D. melanogaster, as well as a locomotor assay. Results. The phytochemical screening test of methanolic leaves extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, coumarins, quaternary bases, phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, and free steroids. A quantitative phytochemical study indicated the total phenol (30.17 +/- 1.44 mg/g), flavonoid (21.64 +/- 0.66 mg/g), and condensed tannins (9.58 +/- 0.99 mg/g). DPPH (345.41 +/- 5.35 mu g/mL) and FRAP (379.98 +/- 39.25 mu M FeSO4/mg sample) show to extract of C. nutans leaves an intermediate value, indicating moderate antioxidant activity of the extract. Antibacterial results revealed only a positive result (antimicrobial activity) for the hexane fraction which significantly inhibited the microorganisms E. epidermidis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei at a concentration of 1000 mu g/mL. TBARS, carbonyl protein, and DCFH demonstrate that the extract has the ability to protect the cell from protein and lipid damage, as well as the inhibition of oxygen-derived radicals at the three concentrations tested: 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/mL. Regarding the toxicity of C. nutans extract against D. melanogaster, it was found that until the concentration of 15 mg/mL, the extract showed no toxicity and that the LC50 obtained was 24 mg/mL. Results show that the C. nutans extract leaves used to prevent PQ damage were effective in reducing flies' mortality and improving locomotor capacity. Conclusion. Our studies demonstrated for the first time that C. nutans crude leaf extract has high antioxidant capacity both in vitro and in vivo through different analysis techniques. These results make it possible to infer future applications in the pharmacological area, evidenced by the low toxicity observed in D. melanogatser, as well as the ability to neutralize different sources of RONS.",ADVANCES IN PHARMACOLOGICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,HINDAWI LTD,,OCIMUM-GRATISSIMUM L.; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; URINARY-EXCRETION; PHENOLIC-ACIDS; ARTEMIA-SALINA; ESSENTIAL OIL; TOXICITY; CAPACITY,"[Bruck de Souza, Letiele; Enderle, Jefferson; Roehrs, Rafael; Gasparotto Denardin, Elton Luis] Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Lab Estudos Fis Quim & Prod Nat LEFQPN, P Box 118, BR-97501970 Uruguaiana, RS, Brazil; [Leitao Gindri, Amanda; de Andrade Fortes, Thainara; Felli Kubica, Thais] Univ Reg Integrada Alto Uruguai & Missoes, Lab Plantas Med, Santiago, RS, Brazil; [Moura e Silva, Sidnei] Univ Caxias do Sul UCS, Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Manfredini, Vanusa] Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Grp Estudos Estresse Oxidat GESTOX, Uruguaiana, RS, Brazil",Chaptalia nutans,,Asteraceae,,"phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, phenolics, steroids, flavonoids, coumarins","phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, phenolics, steroids, flavonoids, coumarins",,,Candida tropicalis,Chaptalia nutans,Asteraceae,Chaptalia,Brazil

Among them, acetone exhibited the highest contents of bioactive compounds. To optimize the extraction process, a statistical approach was adopted using the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The five parameters at five different levels were chosen in the design of the experiments. A total of 32 experimental runs given by the design were fitted into the second-order regression model equation. The analysis of the model shows the best fit of the experimental data with an R2 of 0.9971 and a model F-value of 191.73. The optimal conditions of acetone concentration (56 %), the volume of acetone (22 mL), agitation speed (173 rpm), extraction temperature (31 degrees C), and extraction time (28 h) were noted from desirability function and showed a 2.0-fold increase in the contents of bioactive compounds when compared to unoptimized conditions. Further, the antimicrobial activity of 5 % (w/v) extract was tested against two-gram positive strains Bacillus sp, and Staphylococcus aureus, and two-gram negative strains Escherichia coli, and S. marcescens. The extract exhibited the 21 mm and 18 mm clear zone of diameter with 5 mm standard disc against the gram-positive strains tested whereas no clear zone was found against gram-negative strains. Finally, the antioxidant property was electrochemically analyzed using cyclic voltammetry and Differential pulse voltamme-try, which confirmed the presence of multiple antioxidants in the extract.

Nonwoven fabric products such as face masks, paper wipes, and wound dressings contain antibacterial substances for reduction of bacterial accumulation. Therefore, the use of bioactive compounds from medicinal plants improves the properties of fabrics. This study used a crude extract from Caesalpinia sappan to perform phytochemical screening and investigate its antibacterial activity, stability, hemolytic activity, and preliminary application in nonwoven fabric products. Results: The alcoholic crude extracts of C. sappan heartwood consisted of alkaloids, anthraquinones, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, and cardiac glycosides. The C. sappan extract (CSE) had the highest inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus with inhibition zone of 13.67 +/- 1.56 mm in the agar well diffusion assay. The MIC value of CSE was at 1.95, 1.95, and 0.98 mg/ml, while the MBC value was 62.5, 3.91, and 31.25 mg/ml for S. aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, respectively. The phenolic content was stable at 28 +/- 2 degrees C and at pH 4.0 for 12 h (-95%) and 10 d (>90%), and it had low hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes at 5.04-18.95%. The major chemical component was flavonoids, and brazilein was 1.88% area sum. For the application to antibacterial fabrics, the highest inhibitory activity against S. aureus was found in 2MIC of CSE-coated fabric with 99% for 3 h. Conclusions: The CSE had high inhibitory toward 3 bacterial strains and stability in a wide range of pH and temperature. The CSE-coated nonwoven fabric had efficient inhibition to S. aureus and a possibility to application in a nonwoven product in the future. How to cite: Hemthanon T, Ungcharoenwiwat P.

For this, e-CaS was initially screened for total alkaloids by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Upon considerable results (1.022 mg/g NE) alkaloids were isolated (cA), partially purified (fractionated), and subjected to HPLC and GC-MS. Meanwhile, cA was evaluated for antioxidant property and exposed to determine the antibiofilm activity against Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results Chromatograms have confirmed the presence of distinct varieties of alkaloids, and GC-MS data supports that cA possess substantial antimicrobial nitrogen containing fractions. The zone of inhibition (mm) of B. amyloliquefaciens and P. aeruginosa by cA was found to be 19.02 +/- 0.07 and 20.40 +/- 0.15, respectively; and %inhibition of biofilm was observed to be 63.6 +/- 1.37 and 74.28 +/- 1.04, respectively. In addition, the morphological study of pre and post treatment bacteria through SEM suggests that e-CaS is rich in significant bactericidal alkaloids. Conclusion This study supports that vegetable waste consists of valuable bioactive compounds like, alkaloids, which are effective antibiofilm agents against severe antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, processing the vegetable waste for value added phytochemicals could be insightful in medical and post-harvest management applications.

Growing in Central Asia,"The genus Inula has been used in folk medicine for centuries; however, the data concerning Inula britannica L. are scarce. This study aimed at investigating the chemical composition of methanolic and ethanolic extracts from the aerial parts of I. britannica collected in Kazakhstan and evaluating their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, with special attention being paid to polyphenols. The total content of polyphenols and flavonoids in the extracts was determined colorimetrically, while their qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted using HPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS and RP-HPLC/DAD. Their antioxidant potential was determined using the FRAP and DPPH methods, whereas their antimicrobial activity was determined by the microdilution method towards a panel of reference microorganisms, including pathogens of the human gastrointestinal tract. Chemical analysis demonstrated that the methanolic extract had a higher content of polyphenols (58.02 vs. 43.44 mg GAE/g) and flavonoids (21.69 vs. 13.91 mg QUE/g) than the ethanolic extract. In both extracts, 15 compounds were identified, with the highest contents being those of cynarine (13.96 and 11.68 mg/g) and chlorogenic acid (9.22 and 5.09 mg/g). The DPPH assay showed a higher antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract (19.78 +/- 0.12 mg GAE/g) in comparison to that of the ethanolic extract (15.56 +/- 0.24 mg GAE/g). Similarly, the FRAP method showed that the methanolic extract exerted a much higher antioxidant activity (5.07 +/- 0.18 mmol Fe2+/g) than the ethanolic extract (0.39 +/- 0.01 mmol Fe2+/g). In contrast, both extracts showed similar antimicrobial properties, with the highest activity being that against Helicobacter pylori ATCC 43504 (MIC = 0.125-0.25 mg/mL).

Medicinal plants hold promise as sources of potential antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we investigated the phytochemical constituents and microbicidal capabilities of the ethanolic extract from Nigella sativa (black seed). Gas chromatography analysis (GC) identified 11 compounds, among them thymoquinone, and thymol, contributing to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Antimicrobial assays demonstrated notable inhibition zones against broad spectra of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter, and Bacillus subtilis, along with potent antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Penicillium, and Candida albicans. Notably, when combined with antibiotics, the extract displayed exceptional synergistic antimicrobial efficacy. The black seed extract demonstrated membrane-damaging activity and disrupted virulence factors that protect microbes from antimicrobial agents, including the formation of bacterial biofilm and protease secretion. Thymoquinone, the primary active constituent of the extract, exhibited similar antimicrobial and ant virulence properties. In silico analysis targeting key regulators of quorum sensing and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa, such as RhlG, LasR, and PqsR, showed a remarkable affinity of thymol and thymoquinone for these targets. Moreover, the N. sativa extract exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against both the promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania tropica parasites, hinting at potential antiparasitic activity.

The current study explores the synergism of Moringa oleifera extracts (MOE) with antibiotics, body growth, and public acceptance as a decoction for better health. Plants collected from the South Punjab province of Pakistan were subjected to extraction through reflux extraction and characterized using HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). Phytochemical analysis revealed enriched contents of reducing sugars, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, glycosides, and steroids, all of which possess significant antioxidant potential. The antibacterial activity of MOE showed the highest zones of inhibitions against Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. There was a significant reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotics when used in combination with MOE against bacteria. None of the combinations exhibited antagonistic effects. Feeding MOE led to significant improvements in growth and weight of the mice, while histopathological parameters were significantly higher among all, except for glomerular diameter, sinusoid width, and corpuscle density. The decoction trial showed the highest odd ratio for the acceptability within a preparation having higher proporotion of MOE. The study thus revealed the enriched nutraceutical contents in MO extracts, their potential for synergism with antibiotics, optimized growth effects, and significant public acceptance. (c) 2024 SAAB.

For this purpose, a multivariate optimization of the extraction process was performed, by solid-liquid extraction, where it was observed that the presence of ethanol, acetone, and polysorbate in the extracting solution had the most significant influence on the extraction process, as opposed to temperature, time, volume of extracting solution, and the use of ultrasound. After the mixture system optimization, the best extraction condition was achieved when the extracting solution was composed of 25% ethanol, 25% acetone, and 50% polysorbate 0.25% in water, resulting in an extract containing 27.11 mg of anthocyanins, 457.69 mg of total carotenoids, and 198.09 mg of, total flavonoids, per 100 g of dried flower. The reducing capacity was 466.8 mg GAE per 100 g of dried flower, and the antioxidant activity was 17.25% against the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical. Through chromatographic analysis, it was possible to identify 10 compounds with bioactive properties (ferulic acid dihexoside, pedunculagin, methyl-dihydroquercetin dihexoside, dimethyl-dihydromyricetin diglucoside, kaempferol-3-O-hexosyl-rutinoside-7-O-rhamnoside, quercetin-O-hexoside-O-hexoside, ellagic acid, quercetin-O-hexoside, hesperetin-O-rutinoside, and diosmetin-O-rhamnoside), with a high prevalence of flavonoids. The extract showed no toxicity in an in vivo model of Galleria mellonella when administered at up to 1.6 g kg(-1) of body mass.

To date, comparative studies on the effect of solvent, cold press, and supercritical fluid extraction (SEF) on the quality attributes of black cumin seed oil are scarce. In addition, little information is available in the literature about black cumin seed oils extracted with SFE. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare some physicochemical characteristics, fatty acids composition, triacylglycerol, tocopherol, phytosterol, polyphenols, antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, volatile compounds, antimicrobial activity, functional groups and melting points of oil extracted from black cumin seed by different methods (SFE, cold press, and solvent extraction). In this study, extracted-black seed oils contain high amounts of C18:2 (60.01-58.75%), OLL (37.45-38.87%), gamma-tocopherol (243.26-276.46 mg/100 g oil), and polyphenols (314.08-400.02 mg GAE/kg oil). Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) obtained the highest oil yields (37%). In addition, the oil obtained by SFE has relatively higher unsaturated fatty acids, total tocopherols, phytosterols, and polyphenols than that obtained using cold press and solvent extraction methods. Moreover, SFE-oil had stronger DPPH (1.43 mg/mL) and ABTS (2.69 mg/mL) scavenging activity than solvent-extracted oils. The SFE-oil showed high antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Penicillium roqueforti and contained some characteristics of volatile compounds than that extracted with other extraction methods.

Extracts and Isolated Fractions,"Background. Nigella sativa L. (NS) is an aromatic and medicinal plant commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine. Its grains contain a large amount of fixed oil and have many therapeutic virtues and medicinal properties (antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and anticancer). Aim. The aim of this work is to study the antimicrobial activity of Nigella sativa L. extracts and separated fractions on various pathogenic strains and to correlate that with its chemical composition. Methods. Extracts from Moroccan Nigella sativa seeds were extracted using successive organic solvents, and their hexane and acetone extracts were separated by column chromatography. The chemical composition of extracts, fractions, and essential oil was determined by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD. Extracts and fractions were evaluated for antimicrobial activity through disk diffusion against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria innocua), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and yeast (Candida pelliculosa) for 1 mg/mL concentration. Bacterial strains were followed to study their behaviors over time in different concentrations. The minimum inhibitory concentration of Nigella sativa essential oil was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Results and Conclusion. Although hexane extract was active against both types of bacteria (Gram+ and Gram-), some of its fractions were specifically active against only one type. Fraction (SH4) had the highest activity (15 mm inhibitory diameter). Acetone extract was nonactive but surprisingly resulted in specific active fractions, and the most interesting one was (SA7) that had an inhibitory diameter of 13 mm. This antibacterial effect was related to fatty acids (linoleic and palmitic acids) in (SH4) and 17 pentatriacontene in (SA7). Moreover, the antifungal activity of hexane fractions (10-13 mm) was higher than hexane extract (8 mm), but for acetone, it was the opposite. Acetone extract had a higher activity (18 mm) than its fractions (8-12 mm), except for (SA7) (19 mm). Those inhibitions were attributed to gallic acid, cysteine, and apigenin in acetone extract and cysteine with ascorbic acid in fraction (SA7). Antifungal activity of the essential oil was more pronounced than the antibacterial one. Indeed, determined MICs in the first case were on the microgram scale (MIC = 8 mu g/mL, Candida albicans), while in the second case, they were on the milligram scale (MIC = 0.96 mg/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 mg/mL for Bacillus cereus, and 0.68 mg/mL for Escherichia coli). This antifungal activity was attributed to three major compounds beta-cymene, alpha-thujene, origanene, and thymoquinone. Results of strains behavior over time at different concentrations of the fractions showed all the curves went through a maximum around 20 hours and had a delay of expression of 5 hours at the start. Taking all results into count, Nigella sativa L. extracts and/or derived principles could form promising antimicrobial agents for therapeutical and industrial uses.",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,HINDAWI LTD,,ESSENTIAL OIL; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; ANTIFUNGAL PROPERTIES; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; VOLATILE; ACID; AGENTS; PLANTS; YIELD,"[Tiji, Salima; Benayad, Ouijdane; Laaraj, Nassima; Mimouni, Mostafa] Univ Mohammed First, Fac Sci Oujda, Lab Appl Chem, Team Electrochem, Oujda, Morocco; [Rokni, Yahya; Asehraou, Abdeslam] Univ Mohammed First, Fac Sci Oujda, Lab Bioresources Biotechnol Ethnopharmacol & Hlth, Oujda, Morocco",Nigella sativa,,Ranunculaceae,,"noise, isolated compounds","noise, isolated compounds","Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa","positive, positive, positive, negative, negative",Candida albicans,Nigella sativa,Ranunculaceae,Nigella,Morocco

Pod Residue: A Source of Phenolic Compounds as Valuable Biomolecules,"This study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and a selected group of bioactivities of jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril L.) pod residue. An aqueous extract (deionized water; AE) and a hydroethanolic extract (ethanol: deionized water, 70:30 v/v; ETOH) were obtained via maceration. Ten phenolic compounds were characterized via LC-DAD-ESI/MSn: seven procyanidins, two quercetin derivatives and one taxifolin derivative, with dimers and trimers of procyanidins being the main components of both extracts. Total phenolic compound levels of 2.42 +/- 0.06 and 11 +/- 1 mg/g were found in AE and ETOH, respectively; however, only seven compounds were identified in ETOH. The jatoba pod residue extracts showed notable antioxidant activities: ETOH had greater antioxidant potential in the OxHLIA and DPPH assays (IC50 = 25.4 mu g/mL and 0.71 mu g/mL, respectively); however, EA demonstrated greater potential in the FRAP system (IC50 = 2001.0 mu M TE/mg). Only AE showed antiproliferative potential, being effective against cell lines of gastric (GI50 = 35 +/- 1 mu g/mL) and breast (GI50 = 89 +/- 4 mu g/mL) adenocarcinomas. Likewise, only AE showed modest anti-inflammatory potential (IC50 = 225 +/- 2 mu g/mL) in mouse macrophages. Bacteriostatic effects against bacteria were exerted by both extracts. Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes (MICs = 2.5 mg/mL) were especially sensitive to the ETOH extract.

The medicinal plant Mesua ferrea Linn was identified by Botanical verification and the universal DNA bar-coding technique. The FBMF powder's quality was performed by the micromeritics properties like bulk density, tapped density, angle of repose, Hausner ratio, Carr's index, and optical microscopy method, and physicochemical evaluations were performed by the swelling index, foaming index, loss on drying, extractive values, and ash values. The extract's preliminary phytochemical screening was accomplished by the alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, carbohydrates, and glycoside tests. To ensure the presence of a bioactive compound of each FBMF extract by qualitative HPTLC study against the reference beta-sitosterol Rf value of 0.83 was revealed at 254 nm with a developed solvent system toluene, ethyl acetate, and acetic acid (6:2:0.1) v/v. Many pharmacological benefits, including those related to wound healing, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, analgesic, sedative effects, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and atopic dermatitis, have been demonstrated by this phytosterol. An antimicrobial study was carried out by a well diffusion method and, lastly, measured minimum inhibitory concentration and compared to the marketed active pharmaceutical component. Numerous skin infections of more invasive, serious illnesses are caused by potential antimicrobial activity. Results The universal DNA bar-coding of plant Mesua ferrea Linn has shown a high percentage of identity. The micrometrics properties and physicochemical evaluation of the powder sample of FBMF were in an acceptable range. The preliminary phytochemical screening shows that all extracts contain steroids and carbohydrates. Moreover, flavonoids were found in ethyl acetate and ethanol, and a qualitative HPTLC study confirmed that every extract contains beta-sitosterol. N-hexane extract of FBMF shows the potential antimicrobial activity with Staphylococcus aureus, and the MIC value was observed at 0.062 mg/ml. Conclusion Our research demonstrated that the plant Mesua ferrea Linn has been successfully authenticated by a DNA bar-coding technique, and all extracts of FBMF contain beta-sitosterol.

Ten. and to determine the antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities of different extracts. The Cirsium vulgare (NGBB 7229) plant was collected from Turkey's Trakya region. Crude extracts were obtained using different solvents. The chemical composition of Cirsium vulgare was determined in hexane extract using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were evaluated by Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), the beta-carotene bleaching method, and the determination of superoxide anion scavenging activities. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium, whereas the antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Aspergillus fumigatus by applying microdilution methods. A total of 41 bioactive compounds were identified using the GC-MS library. Terpenoids were found to be dominant (52.89%), and lup-20(29)-en-3-yl-acetate and lupeol were the most abundant terpenoids. The highest total flavonoid content (25.73 mg catechin/g) and antioxidant capacity were found in the methanolic extract. The highest antibacterial activity was detected against Bacillus subtilis in the ethyl acetate extract, and the highest antifungal activity was found against Candida krusei and Aspergillus fumigatus in the hexane extract. The observed antioxidant characteristics of the C. vulgare extracts could be attributed to the presence of flavonoids. The high antifungal activity of the hexane extract against all fungal strains can be attributed to its constituents, i.e., terpenoids.

However, limited research is available to systematically evaluate the effects of extraction methods on the phytochemical composition of SBG and its associated antimicrobial effects. In addition, limited studies have tested SBG as a natural antimicrobial agent on fresh produce such as tomatoes. In the current study, powered roots of SBG were extracted with 60, 80, and 100% ethanol, and their antiviral and antibacterial activities were evaluated. SBG ethanol extracts (SBGEEs) at 6.25 mg/mL showed limited antiviral activities against coliphage MS2 and hepatitis A virus. The SBG 80% ethanol extract (SBG80%EE) exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) against six foodborne pathogens. SBG80%EE had the highest contents of flavonoids and phenolic acids determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among these bioactive compounds, ferulic acid had the lowest MIC and MBC values, 0.4 and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively, followed by baicalein and baicalin. Washing with SBG80%EE (12.5 mg/mL) resulted in >1 log reduction of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Kentucky, Senftenberg, and Enteritidis on surface-inoculated grape tomatoes. None of SBGEE solutions changed the total phenolic content, color, or pH values of grape tomatoes.

Methodology: Several herbal extract formulations were prepared with Petroleum Jelly ointment base. Cicatrin r powder (neomycin-bacitracin) was used as the positive control. The various ointment formulations were applied topically on the wounds daily for 21 days. Daily wound contraction and epithelialisation times were recorded for each group. The antibacterial activity of the extract was also evaluated against some bacteria species implicated in wound infections. The following test organisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Results: The Phytochemical analysis revealed that alkaloids were abundant in the extract. The herbal ointment at various concentrations showed significant (P<. 05) increase in percentage wound contraction on day 9-21 compared with the control group that received only the ointment base. The contraction produced by 40% w/w of the extract was similar to that of Cicatrin r powder on day 6-21. The results also revealed significant (P<. 05) reduction in epithelialisation time exhibited by the extract treated animals compared to those of the control group. The result of antimicrobial studies showed that the extract inhibited the test organisms at concentrations ranging from 200 to 12.5 mg/mL. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of the extract on the test isolates was recorded at 25mg/mL for both S. aureus and E. coli and 6.25mg/ml for K. pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa showed no susceptibility to both the extract and the control drug at the concentrations evaluated. Conclusion: The marked reduction of wound size and epithelialisation time by the extract is an indication of its wound healing potentials.

Cultivated in the Marche Region for Their Use in Cosmetic Products","We are now seeing an increase in the production of agri-food waste, which is an essential resource for the recovery of bioactive compounds that may be employed as innovative natural ingredients in cosmetics. To date, the approach to cosmetics preservation has seen a significant shift in the search for biological components that give healthier alternatives for customers and help businesses operate in an environmentally friendly manner. To achieve this goal, we studied pomegranate extracts using the peel and, for the first time, extracts from the male flowers of a wide pomegranate variety cultivated in the Marche region, specifically, the Wonderful, Mollar de Elche, Parfianka, and less-studied G1 varieties. We studied the phenol compounds profile, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial activity, and cell viability of the obtained pomegranate extracts. The identification and quantification of phenol compounds belonging to different classes, such as hydrolysable tannins, hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid, dihydroflavonol, gallocatechin, and anthocyanins, were performed using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Punicalagin isomers and punicalin resulted in the most abundant polyphenols found in the peel and male flower extracts. Mollar de Elche 2020 peel extract revealed a high concentration of punicalagin A and B (7206.4 mg/kg and 5812.9), while the content of gallic acid revealed high results in the G1 and Parfianka varieties. All extracts were spectrophotometrically analysed to determine their total phenol content (TPC) using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and their antioxidant capacity (AC). In terms of the total phenol obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method, Mollar de Elche 2020 extracts reported the highest TPC content of 12.341 mu mol GAE/g. Results revealed that the Mollar de Elche and Wonderful 2020 peel extracts demonstrated the highest TPC and AC. Furthermore, AC results indicated that the peel extracts displayed higher AC than the male flower extract due to the high punicalagin content detected by UPLC analysis. The antimicrobial activity testing revealed that the Wonderful and G1 2020 peel extracts resulted active against Escherichia coli, while all extracts exhibited promising anticandidal activity. Additionally, the cytocompatibility was evaluated in keratinocytes HaCaT cells by testing concentrations of pomegranate extracts ranging from 0.15 to 5.00 mg/mL. Extracts were non-toxic for the cells in the tested concentration range.

Many of them curtail the normal physiological functioning abilities of the native plants by growing over them, or by producing certain metabolites which control their growth potentials and seed germination abilities. The present study aims to find out the different bioactive compounds like alkaloids and terpenoids responsible for the vast spread of Eupatorium odoratum, Vernonia cinerea, Mikania micrantha, Tridax procumbens, Pilea microphylla and Cuscuta reflexa which are some of the major invasive plants of Kerala. Apart from these negative roles attributed to invasive plants, whether they possessed any beneficial roles was the prime concern of this study. Our study brings to light the allelopathic effects of invasive plants upon legume seeds. Different phytochemicals which are known to produce such effect were present in all these plants. Greatest allelopathic effects were exhibited by C. reflexa and E. odoratum. Against Escherichia coli bacteria, E. odoratum and M. micrantha showed highest zone of inhibition (20 mm, 15 mm) while against Proteus vulgaris bacteria, C. reflexa, M. micrantha and T. procumbens produced inhibition zones of 21 mm, 15 mm and 12 mm. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, C. reflexa, M. micrantha and E. odoratum produced inhibition zones of 16 mm, 13 mm and 12 mm. Alcoholic extract of V. cinerea showed comparatively high inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (10 mm). V. cinerea showed inhibitiory effects against E. coli, S. aureus and P. vulgaris (11 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm).

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods, turbidity (cell density) measurement, and well diffusion assay were used to determine the antimicrobial activity against several species of foodborne bacteria (Gram - , Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni), (Gram + Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens), yeasts (Yarrowia lipolytica, Metschnikowia fructicola, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and fungi (Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani). Carbohydrate and phenolic contents were measured, and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2GREEK TONOS-Azino-bis-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonic acid)) radical scavenging assays were used for the assessment of antioxidant activity. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrums of all samples were also evaluated in order to determine their chemical profiles. The lyophilised pomegranate peel exhibited the highest antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antifungal activity among all samples, while among the goji berry samples-who had only antibacterial and very little or no antifungal activity-the lyophilised aqueous extract with the lowest content of maltodextrin (2%) and highest phenolic content, had also the highest antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antifungal activity. The antioxidant and antimicrobial bioactivities seemed to be related to the content of polyphenols, the low concentration of maltodextrin in the encapsulated lyophilised samples and the use of optimised ultrasound assisted extraction. Minimum inhibitory concentration or zones of inhibition were in many (but not all) cases lower for the aqueous extracts compared to the ethanol or ethanol/hexane extracts of goji berries.

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of A. ursinum extract for six bacterial pathogens were determined using the broth macrodilution method. Although the A. ursinum extract was shown to be effective toward all investigated foodborne bacteria, its antimicrobial activity depended on its concentration and bacterial strain. Listeria monocytogenes was the most sensitive to antimicrobial activity of A. ursinum extract among all tested pathogens. Accordingly, the lowest MIC and MBC of A. ursinum extract were determined for L. monocytogenes (28 and 29 mg/mL). The tested extract showed a similar antimicrobial potential to other examined bacterial strains (Salmonella Enteritidis, Proteus hauseri, Enterococcus faecalis and two strains of Escherichia coli) with MIC and MBC values at concentrations of 29 and 30 mg/mL, respectively. The dependence of the antimicrobial activity of the A. ursinum extract on the level of contamination of tested pathogens was also observed. The increase in the contamination level caused an intense reduction in antibacterial potential of the A. ursinum extract. The composition of the A. ursinum extract was analyzed and found to be a good source of polyphenols and sulfur compounds. However, considering the applied extraction method and the HPLC analysis of bioactive compounds, the antimicrobial potential may be attributed more to polyphenol content.

The aim of this study was to compare EAE and solid-liquid extraction (SLE), to evaluate the impact on bioactive compounds' extraction yield, phytochemical composition, and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic properties of Aralia cordata leaves and roots, sea buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides, and hemp Cannabis sativa leaves. The results indicate that EAE with Viscozyme L enzyme (EAE_Visc) extracts of the tested plant leaves possess the highest yield, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic content. Moreover, the EAE_Visc extract increased by 40% the total sugar content compared to the control extract of A. cordata root. Interestingly, the sea buckthorn leaf extracts exhibited alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, which reached an almost 99% inhibition in all extracts. Furthermore, the sea buckthorn leaves SLE and EAE_Visc extracts possess antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine changes in cell wall morphology after EAE.

The roots (radix) of G. lutea are described in the European Pharmacopeia, but knowledge about the chemical composition and biological activities of its aerial parts is still limited. Thus, until today aerial parts of this species have not been used in medical treatments or consumed. Therefore, flowers, leaves, and stems extracts of G. lutea obtained by using four different extraction solvents (petrol ether, chloroform, ethanol, and water) were examined for their chemical composition and biological activities. High concentrations of salicylic acid, apigenin, and naringenin were recorded for ethanol stem extracts, while significant amounts of kaempferol were detected in leaves and flowers in chloroform and water extracts, respectively. The highest antioxidant potential was recorded for flower and stem petrol ether extracts with the lowest IC50 values, ranging from 94.46 +/- 9.45 to 105.38 +/- 10.54 mu g/mL. Ethanol extracts of flowers and stems showed moderate antioxidant activity (IC50 143.15 +/- 14.32 and 146.90 +/- 14.69 mu g/mL) as well as strong antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans (21.00 +/- 1.00 and 27.50 +/- 1.78 mm inhibition zones, respectively). In addition, ethanol extracts had higher antimycotic activity compared to naturally occurring phenolic compounds that are used as positive controls. Moreover, statistical analysis of the activities of plant extracts and single compounds showed that levels of chlorogenic and caffeic acids strongly correlate with the biological activities of the extracts, i.e., they are the main carriers of these biological activities.

The mechanisms of antibacterial activity of Polish melilot honey were investigated for the first time. Polish melilot honey samples (Melilotus albus biennial=3 and annual=5, Melilotus officinalis=1) were collected directly from beekeepers and analysed for pollen profile, basic physicochemical parameters, antioxidant capacity, radical scavenging activity, total phenolic contents as well as antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. The physicochemical properties of melilot honey were specific for light-coloured unifloral honey samples and were not dependent on its botanical and geographical origin (P>005). All tested honey samples exhibited inhibitory activity (above 90%) against Gram-positive bacteria at the concentration of 125-25%. Above 30-50% of antibacterial activity of melilot honey was connected with glucose oxidase enzyme action and was destroyed in the presence of catalase. Hydrogen peroxide-dependent antibacterial activity of honey was inversely correlated with its radical scavenging activity (r=-067) and phenolic compounds (r=-061). Antibacterial action of melilot honey depends not only on hydrogen peroxide produced by glucose oxidase, but also on other nonperoxide bioactive components of honey. Significance and Impact of the StudyMelilot honey is used in traditional medicine as an anticoagulant agent due to the possibility of the presence of the coumarin compounds which are specific for Melilotus plant. Melilotus albus is rarely used to produce honey, and antibacterial properties of this variety of honey had not been studied yet. Nine samples of melilot honey produced in different regions of Poland were analysed according to their antibacterial activity which was correlated with physiochemical parameters and antioxidant activity. It was shown that antibacterial activity of melilot honey is created by hydrogen peroxide and other bioactive compounds.",LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,WILEY,antimicrobials; Escherichia coli; food; Salmonella; Staphylococci,ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; FLORAL SOURCES; FINGERPRINTS; COMPONENTS; COLOR,"[Sowa, P.; Wesolowska, M.; Swacha, S.; Dzugan, M.] Univ Rzeszow, Fac Biol & Agr, Dept Chem & Food Toxicol, Cwiklinskiej 1a, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland; [Grabek-Lejko, D.] Univ Rzeszow, Fac Biol & Agr, Dept Biotechnol & Microbiol, Rzeszow, Poland",Melilotus albus,,Fabaceae,,"phenolics, coumarins","phenolics, coumarins","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae","positive, negative, negative",,Melilotus albus,Fabaceae,Melilotus,Poland

Smith,"The chemical constituents and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of fresh rhizome essential oil (FR-EO) and dry rhizome essential oil (DR-EO) of Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith obtained from Southwest China were compared. Zerumbone was the predominant component in both FR-EO and DR-EO (75.0% and 41.9%, respectively). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were all demonstrated to have significant antimicrobial capacity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 31.25 to 156.25 mu g/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 62.50 to 625.00 mu g/mL. Zerumbone showed the strongest antimicrobial potential against all tested microorganisms compared with the fresh and dry rhizome essential oils. FR-EO was found to be more active than DR-EO against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all showed significant cytotoxic activity against K562, PC-3, and A549 human tumor cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Zerumbone exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity against all tested human tumor cell lines with an IC50 of 4.21-11.09 mu g/mL for 72 h incubation, as compared with the fresh and dry rhizome oils. The cytotoxic activity of FR-EO (IC50: 10.48-14.51 mu g/mL for 72 h) was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of DR-EO (IC50: 13.83-33.24 mu g/mL for 72 h). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone exhibited selective cytotoxic activity to tumor cells, with a significantly low cytotoxicity to normal cells (MRC-5, IC50: 56.98-147.29 mu g/mL). However, FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all exhibited weak free-radical-scavenging activity according to DPPH and ABTS analysis. The findings highlighted in this study show that FR-EO provides appreciably higher content of the bioactive compound, zerumbone, and has higher antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties than DR-EO.

This study aimed to uncover the presence of different metabolites and to investigate the biological properties of the leaves of Mangifera indica during summer and winter seasons. The extract of M. indica leaves for summer and winter using different solvent extracts (hexane, chloroform, and methanol) showed the presence of phenols, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids, phytosterol, saponins, steroids, and carbohydrates. Antibacterial activity of the methanolic leaf extracts for summer and winter were evaluated against the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). For S. aureus (ATTC 43300), the summer crude extract displayed lower antibacterial activity than the control streptomycin, with zones of inhibition of 14.17 and 16.67 mm, respectively. Winter extracts had a zone of inhibition of 12 mm, while streptomycin had a 13.67 mm zone of inhibition. For E. coli (ATCC 25922), the summer crude extract displayed higher antibacterial activity than the control gentamycin, with zones of inhibition of 18.05 and 17.5 mm, respectively. The winter extracts had a zone of inhibition of 8.5 mm, while gentamycin had a 14.5 mm zone of inhibition. Antibacterial screening showed positive results for both seasons; however, summer extracts showed a more potent effect. The antioxidant screening was conducted using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH) assay. Potent radical scavenging activity was exhibited for both summer and winter seasons with hexane and methanolic extracts for summer (IC50 of 19.53 mu g/mL and 12.71 mu g/mL, respectively) and winter (22.32 mu g/mL and 14.35 mu g/mL, respectively) in comparison to the control ascorbic acid, which produced an IC50 of 3.20 mu g/mL. The summer leaf extracts had better radical scavenging IC50 capacity than winter extracts.

The toxicity against MRC-5 fibroblast cells was evaluated to assess selectivity. The in vitro assays were performed following the recommendations of WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and revealed moderate activity, with the propolis extracts presenting the relatively highest inhibitory effect against T. brucei. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum and Aspergillus fumigatus was also verified with the better results observed against T. rubrum. The quality of the extracts was controlled by evaluating the phenolic content and antioxidant activity.

The antimicrobial activity of Mono-floral Agastache honey produced from Australian grown Agastache rugosa was compared with the activity of commercially available honeys derived from Leptospermum species and with Jarrah honey for activity against clinical and non-clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coll. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Agastache honey was in the range of 6-25% (w/v) for all species examined. The MICs for Leptospermum honeys were generally similar to those of Agastache honey, but MICs were higher for Super manuka and Jarrah honeys and lower for Tea tree honey. Staphylococci were more susceptible to all honeys than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coll. Pretreatment of honey with catalase increased the bacterial growth at MIC of Tea tree honey (35%), Super Manuka (15%), Jarrah honeys (12%), and Agastache honey (10%), indicating variable contributions of hydrogen peroxide to antimicrobial activity. Manuka and Jelly bush honeys retained their antimicrobial activity in the presence of catalase, indicating the presence of other antimicrobial compounds in the honey. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and used to identify possible antimicrobial phenolic compounds in Agastache honey and flowers, and five commercial honeys.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to establish the chemical composition of the essential oil of flower, leaves of F. tingitana, and to throw light on antimicrobial, cytotoxic activities of Libyan plant. Materials and Methods: The chemical composition of the essential oil of flower (0.06% w/v) and leaves (0.1% w/v) of F. tingitana was comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using nonpolar column DB-5. Results: A total of 28-32 components were identified, 15 being common in both samples.

Moreover, we investigated their activity against four common bacterial strains responsible for food contamination (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus) by formation of biofilms. The susceptibility of bacterial biofilms was evaluated by crystal violet assay, whereas the metabolic changes occurring in the bacterial cells were ascertained through the MTT test.

Materials and Methods: Dried ground leaves were subjected to a cold extraction method using an absolute concentration of methanol, ethanol, and water. Total phenolic, flavonoid, and proanthocyanidin content was estimated by using a linear regression equation from the calibration curve and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and rutin equivalent (RE). Antioxidant properties were determined using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl), nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide assay, and their IC50 values were calculated. The antibacterial activity was tested using the agar well diffusion method against the common five pathogenic strains, and the zone of inhibition is compared with gentamicin (1 mg/mL) as a positive control. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value was obtained by the microbroth dilution method. The antidandruff assay was performed on Malassezia furfur by the disk diffusion method into Sabouraud dextrose agar overlaid with 1 mL of olive oil, and the MIC value was determined by the microtiter plate method. Results: The result showed that the Artemisia methanolic extract represents ample content of phenolics (248 +/- 3.29 mg/g of GAE), flavonoids (222.33 +/- 4.41 mg/g of RE), and proanthocyanidin (222.83 +/- 1.62 mg/g of RE equivalent). The antioxidant assay revealed that methanolic extract has the highest radical scavenging activity followed by aqueous extract and then ethanolic extract. The antibacterial activity of leaf extract shows MIC value ranging from 6 to 25 mu g/mL against various human pathogenic bacteria.

Objective: The present study evaluated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Eupatorium triplinerve extracts from different parts of the plant and identified the extract with the highest antimicrobial potential. Materials and methods: Extracts were obtained by maceration of all parts of plant, and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation of methanol extract by partition column chromatography. The major chemical groups, saponins, reducing sugars, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, and others were screened by standard techniques. The antimicrobial activity of the different extracts was performed by microdilution assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were reported. Results: Phytochemical screening of hydroalcoholic extract from all parts of Eupatorium triplinerve identified mainly steroids, coumarins, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, depsides and absence of polysaccharides and flavonoids. The methanol extract of leaves presented the highest content of coumarins and lower MIC values of 62 and 75 mu g/mL against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. In addition, its non-polar fractions showed antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 16 to 125 mu g/mL against Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli. Discussion and conclusion: Data showed that non-polar fractions of Eupatorium triplinerve methanolic extract has better antimicrobial activity and most likely depends on the presence of several compounds, such as depsidones, coumarins, saponins, and triterpenes on crude extract.

They were also investigated for their in vitro antimicrobial action against different bacteria and fungi, as well as for their mutagenic and antimutagenic activities. A relevant content of the active compounds was found, showing cultivar Lampo a higher content of polyphenols and a greater antioxidant potential. The antimicrobial action was different, exhibiting the compounds from variety Lampo a discrete activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Penicillium expansum, whereas extracts from Teseo showed inhibition against E. coli and Debaryomyces hansenii. The antimutagenic activity, assayed with Ames test by using the Salmonella typhimurium Histidine-requiring strain TA100, was significant, with a percentage of mutagenicity inhibition comparable to the negative control. The two cultivars could be of great interest as relevant polyphenols sources and for their antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties.

The information gathered from our work can contribute to a better selection of those genotypes of C. annum potentially exploitable for giving high-quality products, in terms of biochemical compounds and antioxidant activity. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, it is reasonable to explore new sources of natural compounds with antibiotic activities: our study showed the possibility to use the extracts of two genotypes of a common edible plant, like sweet pepper, as harmless and economical antibacterial and antifungal compounds.

This study was carried out to evaluate the antifungal and antioxidant activities of methanol, chloroform, and aqueous extracts of Annona squamosa Linn. leaves. The antifungal activities of all extracts of A. squamosa leaves against five different strains of fungi (Alternaria altemata, Candida albicans, Fusarium solani, Microsporum canis, and Aspergillus niger) were evaluated by the agar well diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each extract was assessed by antifungal susceptibility using the broth microdilution method. The antioxidant potential of each extract was determined by free radicals (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide) scavenging activity and reducing power property of A. squamosa leaves. Both organic and aqueous extracts were found to express dose-dependent inhibition against all tested fungi strains in both agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods. The free radical scavenging activity and reducing power property of all extracts were found to be concentration dependent, with the methanol extract exhibiting higher antioxidant activity than the chloroform extract, which was more effective than the aqueous extract of A. squamosa leaves. Results of phytochemical analysis of extracts showed the presence of glycosides, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, phenols, etc. The results obtained from in vitro studies of antifungal and antioxidant activities clearly suggest that the methanol, chloroform, and aqueous extracts of A. squamosa leaves possess antifungal and antioxidant activity.

We report the antimicrobial activities against a wide range of bacteria, yeast, and fungi. The antioxidant activities were tested using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, and 2-2 '-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assays. We report also for the first time the effect of the swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Our results showed that the tested two extracts were a rich source of phenols, flavonoids, and tannins with different degrees. Additionally, eleven phytoconstituents were identified by LC/MS technique (Hibiscus acid: 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-feruloylquinic acid, cyanidin 3-o-glucoside, myricetin, quercetin 7-o-rutinoside, quercetin 3-o-glucoside, delphinidin 3-o-sambubioside, and kaempferol 3-o-p-coumaroyl-glucoside). Also, it was shown that the calyx extract can scavenge 86% of the DPPH radical, while the rate of 53% and 23% of inhibition of the DPPH was obtained only at the concentration of 125 and 50 mu g/mL, and a small inhibition was made at a concentration of 5 mu g/mL. Roselle extracts inhibited the growth of the selected microorganisms at low concentrations, while higher concentrations are needed to completely kill them. However, no activity against CVB-3 was recorded for both extracts. In addition, the obtained extracts reduced the swarming motility of P. aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/ml. The docking simulation showed acceptable binding affinities (up to -9.6 kcal/mol) and interaction with key residues of 1JIJ, 2QZW, and 2UVO.

This study evaluates the in vitro antimicrobial activities from commercially sourced Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai (Polypodiaceae) whose authenticity was confirmed by DNA barcoding based on the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene. Powdered rhizomes were sequentially extracted using n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at ambient temperature. The dried extracts at different concentrations were tested for antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Mycobacterium smegmatis. D. crassirhizoma extracts exhibited significant antimicrobial activities only against MRSA (minimum inhibitory concentration: 3.125 mu g/ml n-hexane extract). Activity-led fractionations of D. crassirhizoma and characterization by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) targeted a fraction (A3), with two anti-MRSA phloroglucinol derivatives, flavaspidic acid AB and norflavaspidic acid AB-being greatly enriched in the latter. The impact of A3 on MRSA cells was examined using untargeted metabolomic analysis and compared to that of other established antibiotics (all treatments normalized to MIC50 at 6 h). This suggested that norflavaspidic acid AB had distinctive effects, one of which involved targeting bioenergetic transformation, metabolism, and particularly acetyl-CoA, on MRSA cells. No cytotoxicity was observed for the norflavaspidic acid AB-enriched fraction against murine HepG2 cells.

Moench is a member of Lamiaceae family and important ethnomedicinal that is widely used in the treatment of several ailments and is reputed to possess an inhibitor of the dengue virus. In vitro propagation is an efficient strategy for large-scale production of plantlets. Such process is a good alternative method for the production of valuable secondary metabolites. Hence, the present study assesses the contents of phenolic compounds, radical scavenging activity and antimicrobial efficacy of in vivo grown compared with the in vitro grown B. polystachyon plants. Thus, the antioxidant capacity of leaf extracts was determined by scavengers like ABTS.+, DPPH., hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide along with lipid peroxidation inhibition, FRAP, reducing power and DNA damage protection assay. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated through disk diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration assay. RP-HPLC was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds in the following forms: free, esterified and glyco-sylated. The leaf extract of in vivo plants exhibited stronger antioxidant activities. The FRAP assay revealed a maximum reducing power with leaf extract of in vivo grown plants (43.73 +/- 0.52 mM Fe(II) equivalent). Total phenolic content of in vivo plants presented a strong positive correlation to IC50 values of ABTS, DPPH, and HPSA, whereas total flavonoid content of in vitro grown plant was strongly correlated to IC50 values of DPPH and HPSA. In vivo plants showed the highest inhibition zone against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. RP-HPLC analysis showed the phenolic compounds present in all tested forms of B. polystachyon leaf. For the first time, gallic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin and vanillic acid were identified in this extract.

Moreover, the results of in vitro and in vivo antioxidant capacity evaluation suggested its possibility to be used as natural antioxidant. This fruit also exhibited antimicrobial activity toward Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in low doses. Finally, in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion showed a partial bioaccessibility of (poly) phenols (similar to 50% at the final step), showing high antioxidant capacity in the different GI phases. These results revealed Andean blueberry as an interesting candidate for being used as a functional ingredient and the development of further in vivo and clinical assays.",FOODS,MDPI,mortino; Vaccinium floribundum; HPLC-MS/MS; anthocyanins; antioxidant; antimicrobial; toxicity; zebrafish,VACCINIUM-FLORIBUNDUM KUNTH; ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; FRUITS; IDENTIFICATION; ANTHOCYANINS; POLYPHENOLS; BLACKBERRY; BERRIES; VALIDATION,"[Baenas, Nieves] Univ Murcia, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Food Technol Food Sci & Nutr, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Ruales, Jenny; Martinez-Cifuentes, Gabriela; Garcia-Ruiz, Almudena] Escuela Politecn Natl, Dept Food Sci & Biotechnol, Quito 17012759, Ecuador; [Moreno, Diego A.] CSIC, CEBAS, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Phytochem & Hlth Foods Lab, Campus Espinardo,Edificio 25, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Barrio, Daniel Alejandro] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, CIT Rio Negro, Don Bosco Leloir S-N, RA-8500 Viedma, Argentina; [Stinco, Carla M.; Melendez-Martinez, Antonio J.] Univ Seville, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Food Colour & Qual Lab, Fac Farm, Seville 41012, Spain; [Garcia-Ruiz, Almudena] UAM, Madrid Inst Adv Studies IMDEA Food, Lab Epigenet Lipid Metab, CEI,CSIC, Madrid 28049, Spain",##reus,Vaccinium floribundum,,Ericaceae,"flavonoids, carotenoid, phenolics","flavonoids, carotenoid, phenolics","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Vaccinium floribundum,Ericaceae,Vaccinium,Spain

The appearance of more and more microbial strains resistant to classical treatments led to the need to develop new treatments. Allium plants are known for their antimicrobial properties due to their high content of thiosulfinates, especially allicin, polyphenols or flavonoids. The hydroalcoholic extracts of six Allium species obtained by cold percolation were analyzed regarding their phytochemical compounds and antimicrobial activity. Among the six extracts, Allium sativum L. and Allium ursinum L. have similar contents of thiosulfinates (approx. 300 mu g allicin equivalents/g), and the contents of polyphenols and flavonoids were different between the tested species. The HPLC-DAD method was used to detail the phytochemical composition of species rich in thiosulfinates. A. sativum is richer in allicin (280 mu g/g) than A. ursinum (130 mu g/g). The antimicrobial activity of A. sativum and A. ursinum extracts against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis can be correlated with the presence of large amounts of thiosulfinates. Both extracts have shown results against Candida species (inhibition zones of 20-35 mm) and against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zones of 15-25 mm).

Phytochemical analysis of the dried roots of Tamarix indica (Tamaricaceae) indicated the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins and tannins. The pharmacological interest of these compounds, coupled with the use of this plant in traditional medicine prompted the researchers to check for its possible antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in animal models. The antinociceptive activity was studied using acetic acid-induced writhing in mice while anti-inflammatory tests were studied by using carrageenin induced rat paw edema model. Moreover, antibacterial activities were studied by using the disc diffusion method. The extract produced significant writhing inhibition in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice at the oral dose of 500 mg kg(-1) body weight (p<0.001) comparable to the standard drug diclofenac sodium at the dose of 25 mg kg(-1) of body weight. When given orally to rats at dose of 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), the extract showed a significant (p<0.001) anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenin induced paw edema in rats comparable to the standard drug aspirin.

This study aims to investigate the antitrypanosomal, antimicrobial and antiviral activities of methanol (ME) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of B. marginatum aerial parts and the ability of both extracts to inhibit the growth of different cancer cell lines. Methods: Phytochemical characterization of the extracts was performed by LC-MS profiling. The antitrypanosomal activity was evaluated using the resazurin method. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar diffusion and microdilution methods, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. The antiviral activity was determined for 6.25, 12.5, and 50 mu g/mL doses using a plaque reduction assay. Cytotoxicity was investigated in eight cancer cell lines (Caco-2, CCL-81, CCRF-CEM, COS-7, HL-60, MIA PaCa-2, MCF-7, and PANC-1) using the MTT assay and the caspase 3/7 activity was determined over the range of 62.5-1000 mu g/mL. Results: Phytochemical analyses resulted in the characterization of 15 components, mainly flavonoids and lignans.

The ethanol extract of CTT leaves was fractionated, then obtained ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), n-butyl alcohol fraction (nBF) and water residue fraction (WF). UPLC-PDA method was adopted for chemical composition analysis; Four chemical methods, including DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging, reducing power and ORAC assays were adopted for the determination of antioxidant activities; MIC method was employed to test inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus growth. Eight phenolic compounds were identified, including gallic acid, rutin, ellagic acid, hyperin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, quercetin and keampferol. EAF contained higher contents of all identified components except rutin. Meantime, WF contained more un-retained, high polar compounds. All fractions exhibited antioxidant activities. EAF exhibited strongest antioxidant activity, nBF taken second place, while antioxidant of WF was weakest. The anti-bacterial activity was also found in order of EAF > nBF > WF. Results of bioactivity tests were in accordance to the relative content of most identified phenolic compounds, which indicate that identified compounds may be responsible for the bioactivity of CTT leaves. This study provided evidence for the selection of EAF of C-IT leaves as a bioactivity resource, which might improve the development and application of CTT leaves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the underpinning pharmacological mechanism of skin relief functionality, the quantitative profile of phytochemicals in the leaf extract has been performed. Twenty phytochemical components including eight flavonoids, three phenolic acids, and nine triterpenoids were identified and quantitatively analyzed from the SF leaves. The dominant flavonoids of the SF leaves were found to be catechin and myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside. Gallic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid. Among triterpenoids, asiatic acid, corosolic acid, and betulinic acid exhibited a high concentration ranging 2.78-8.59, 3.19-3.91, and 3.58-6.14 mg/g dry leaf, respectively. The total triterpenoid contents were 14.18-19.00 mg/g dry leaf which were 3-fold higher than those in the Indonesian Centella asiatica leaves. In human keratinocytes assay, industrial scale extract of SF significantly reduced expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and cyclooxygenase-2.

In this context, Rhus microphylla (Rm) and Myrtillocactus geometrizans (Mg) fruits have been used as folk remedies and to make traditional foods, respectively; however, studies on their composition and bioactivity are limited. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the yields, phenolic composition, and bioactive properties (scavenging and reducing capacities, antiproliferative, and antifungal) of aqueous and hydroalcohol extracts of Rm and Mg fruits obtained by conventional agitation and ohmic heating (OH). The results showed that the Rm fruit extracts had the highest total phenolic content (TPC) values and the strongest scavenging and reducing capacities compared to those of Mg fruits, being characterized by the presence of gallic acid, while the composition of the Mg extracts varied with respect to the extraction conditions used. Regarding antifungal activity in vitro against two phytopathogenic fungi, Rhizopus stolonifer and Fusarium oxysporum, the hydroalcohol extracts obtained by conventional agitation of both plants (RmH-C and MgH-C) showed the best inhibitory effect, respectively. Interestingly, none of the extracts under study presented cytotoxicity against the noncancerous ARPE-19 cell line, while three extracts of Rm fruit exhibited a moderate antiproliferative activity against HeLa (cancerous) cell line.

The study investigated a complex preparation containing various raspberry ellagitannins at a concentration of 86% w/w, as well as pure lambertianin C and sanguiin H-6. The ellagitannin preparation was obtained by extracting raspberry press cake and purifying the extract using Amberlite XAD resin, while individual compounds were isolated by means of preparative HPLC. The complex preparation was analyzed for the content of ellagitannins, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols using HPLC and LC-MS. The antifungal activity of the complex ellagitannin preparation and the isolated ellagitannins was determined for the strain Geotrichum candidum. The MIC and MFC values (10.0 mg/mL and 30.0 mg/mL, respectively) were found to be the same for lambertianin C, sanguiin H-6, and the complex ellagitannin preparation. The fungistatic activity of the studied ellagitannin preparation at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, as determined by the poisoned medium method, was 65.2% following 6 day incubation of Geotrichum candidum, with the linear growth rate of only 16.2 mm/day.

(Fabaceae),"Ethnopharmacological relevance: The bark of Erythrina stricta Roxb. (Fabaceae) has been used in Indian indigenous systems as a remedy for rheumatism, stomach-ache, asthma, dysentery, contact dermatitis, eczema and skin infections. However, there have been limited phytochemical or biological studies on the bark of E. stricta and there are no studies that align with its traditional medicinal uses. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the stem bark of E. stricta to support its topical use in the treatment of contact dermatitis, eczema and skin infections and to isolate and identify any bioactive compounds. Materials and methods: MTT microdilution and disc diffusion assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of the bark of E. stricta. Column and preparative thin layer chromatography were used for the purification of the dichloromethane extract. The structures of the compounds isolated were elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques and comparison with published data. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by DPPH free radical scavenging and FRAP assays and the antioxidant activity of the pure compounds by dot-blot and DPPH staining methods. Results: The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-hexane extracts showed the most significant activity with MIC values of 7.8 mu g/mL, 125 mu g/mL, and 125 mu g/mL against a sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts also showed significant activity against Candida albicans with MIC values of 125 mu g/mL and 1 mg/mL respectively. GC-MS analysis of the n-hexane extract showed the presence of the antibacterial and antifungal compounds beta-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, alpha-selinene, beta-selinene, selin-11-en-4-alpha-ol, alpha-copaene and delta-cadenine. Phytochemical studies of the dichloromethane extract led to the isolation of the novel compound erynone (1), together with six known compounds; wighteone (2), alpinum isoflavone (3), luteone (4), obovatin (5), erythrinassinate B (6) and isovanillin (7). Luteone (4) exhibited the most significant antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory quantity (MIQ) values of 1.88 mu g, 1.88 mu g and 3.75 mu g, respectively, against sensitive (MSSA) and resistant strains (MRSA and MDRSA) of S. aureus using a TLC bioautography assay. Erynone (1) exhibited the greatest DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Conclusions: Seven compounds, including a new chromanone, were isolated from the antimicrobial dichloromethane extract of the stem bark of E. stricta. Six of the seven compounds showed antibacterial and/or antioxidant activities. These findings provide support for the customary (traditional and contemporary) use of E. stricta bark for the treatment of skin and wound infections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Escherichia Coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhii. Phytochemical screening of the leaf extracts in solvents of varying polarity; viz., water, methanol, ethanol and acetone were also carried out. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by the reducing power assay using ascorbic acid as standard. Well diffusion method was used to assess the antimicrobial effect of the extracts on both Gram positive and Gram negative micro-organisms. Well known chemical procedures were used for the detection of the phytochemical components. The aqueous extract exhibited maximum antioxidant activity compared to the organic solvent extracts. Acetone extract showed broad spectrum antimicrobial effect against all the tested micro-organisms while the methanolic extract was active against all microorganisms used, except E. coli. The ethanolic extract was active against Salmonella typhii, and Staphylococcus aureus whereas the aqueous extract exhibited an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus only. The phytochemical screening indicated the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides etc., in the extracts. We believe that the higher reducing power of the aqueous extract could be due to the better solubility of the antioxidant components in water whereas the predominant antibacterial activity in organic solvent extracts as compared to aqueous extracts, indicates that the active components responsible for the bactericidal activity are more soluble in organic solvents.

Palm Date Seeds","Background: There is growing evidence that antibiotic resistance is increasing. As a result, the efficacy of these antibiotics is gradually declining. This poses a serious health risk in terms of treatment strategies. Therefore, the scientific community is continuously putting all efforts into looking for novel and green therapeutics to overcome the problem of antibiotic resistance. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the chemical composition of the methanolic extracts obtained from Phoenix dactylifera seeds, known agricultural waste, to identify new bioactive compounds and to examine the antibacterial and antifungal potentials. Materials and Methods: Phytochemical profiling was performed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. For the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract, 12 microorganisms were selected, including eight bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736) and four Candida species (C. albicans ATCC 10231, C. tropicalis ATCC 1362, C. utilis ATCC 9255, and C. guilliermondii ATCC 6260). The antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was supported by in silico molecular docking analysis. Results: The obtained results from the GC-MS technique revealed the presence of 51 compounds, of which 6-octadecenoic acid (Z) was identified as the major component. The tested extract exhibited the highest zone of inhibition against S. aureus (growth inhibition zone 14.66 +/- 0.57 mm). In addition, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration values obtained against S. aureus were 1.4 and 5.6 mg/mL, respectively. Regarding the antifungal assay, C. albicans was the most sensitive one to the extract among all the tested Candida strains (14.33 mm) (MIC: 1.4 mg/mL, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC): 11.2 mg/mL). The binding free energies and root mean square deviation values obtained from the interaction of phytochemicals with two different target receptors (1JIJ and 2QZW for TyrRS from S. aureus and aspartic proteinase from C. albicans) were also determined. Ergost-5-en-3-ol, (3beta) established hydrogen, electrostatic, alkyl, and pi-alkyl interactions with five different amino acid residues (Asp40, Asp80, Pro53, His50, and Phe54) located at the TyrRS receptor of S. aureus. On the other hand, hexadecanoic acid and methyl ester established hydrogen, electrostatic, pi-sigma, and alkyl interactions with five different amino acid residues (Thr222, Asp86, Asp218, Tyr84, and Ile123) located at the aspartic proteinase receptor of C. albicans. These interactions contributed to the stability of the complex and, hence, to the biological activity of the P. dactylifera compounds.

Methods: Leaves from all different plant mangrove species located in five mangrove zones of the Pacific coast of Panama were collected according to standard procedures. Qualitative phytochemical analysis of the organic extracts was performed by thin layer chromatography. The antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, toxicity against Artemia salina, anticancer activity in MCF-7 cell line, and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa of all organic extract were investigated according protocols stablished in our institution. Finally, the ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of alpha -glucosidase was evaluated by monitoring the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl alpha -D-glucopyranoside. Results: Thirty-three different samples belonging to nine different species of vascular plants with seeds of true mangroves were collected. Triterpenoids, phenolics, and tannins were the main groups of compounds found in the sampled mangroves. Saponins, quinones, and coumarins were found in less than 50% of the samples.

However, plants of this genus are well known for their phyto-medicinal and ethnopharmacological values. This study evaluated the preliminary phytochemistry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis, total phenolic contents, in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the crude hexane, chloroform andmethanol extracts of the leaves and stembark of G. lasiocarpa. The antimicrobial activity was investigated by agar-well diffusion method against selected clinical strains. The in vitro antioxidant assay of the crude extracts was done using 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The phenolic content was measured using Folin-Ciocalteu's assay. The cytotoxicity of the crude extracts was tested using MTT assay on HEK293, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. In all the extracts, tannins, flavonoids, phenols and carbohydrates are among the primary and secondary metabolites confirmed to be present, while the FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of all extracts confirmed the presence of alkanes, aromatic and alkyl halides in all extracts of the leaves and stembark. Among, the major compounds found in all extracts phytol, friedelin, n-hexadecanoic acid were present in the leaves, while in the stem bark, hexadecane, lup-20(29)-en-3-ol, acetate and hexanedioic acidwere present. The methanol extracts of the leaves and stembark had the lowest IC50 value of 0.02 mu g/mL and 1.34 exp.(-5) mu g/mL (DPPH), while for FRAP the methanol extract of the leaves and chloroform extract of the stem had the lowest IC50 value of 9.76 and 12 mu g/mL, respectively. The methanol extract of the leaves and stembark had the highest phenolic content of 132.82 +/- 0.22 and 171.12 +/- 0.39 mgGAE/g dried extract. Most of the isolates showed varying degree of sensitivity to the extracts, with the hexane extracts of the leaves and stem bark having a remarkable inhibitory effect against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ACCC 14026).

Here, we studied the phytochemical constituents, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of papaya waste (peel and seeds) samples obtained from the local market in Jammu district of Jammu & Kashmir. Antimicrobial assessment using the agar-well diffusion method revealed the substantial efficacy of both the extracts. At a concentration of 100 mu g/mL, both papaya peel and seed ethanolic extracts exhibited substantial zones of inhibition against Escherichia coli (16.00 +/- 1.00 mm and 19.40 +/- 1.15 mm), Bacillus cereus (21.50 +/- 1.00 mm and 08.00 +/- 1.00 mm), Klebsiella pneumoniae (25.50 +/- 1.00 mm and 20.00 +/- 1.00 mm) and Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 +/- 1.15 mm and 7.50 +/- 1.00 mm), respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the macro broth dilution method, indicating that the seed extract had a maximum MIC of 100 mu g/mL against all test pathogens, surpassing the peel extract. The qualitative analysis showed that phytochemicals including tannins, saponins, alkaloids and phytosteroids were absent in both the extracts. The bioactive potential of papaya peel and seeds is quantified by determining their total phenol content and total flavonoid content. The papaya seeds exhibited TPC of 62.45 mg GAE's/gdw and a TFC of 47.84 mg QE's/gdw, followed by papaya seeds. The peel extract demonstrated significant antioxidant potential, exhibiting remarkable DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50 value: 55.50 mu g/mL) and beta-carotene/linoleic acid assay (IC50 value: 75.80 mu g/mL), surpassing the seed extract.

(R. acetosella) were examined in this study. Materials and Methods: The chemical composition of R. acetosella methanol extract was identified by the LC-MS/MS method. The antioxidant activity was tested using beta-carotene/linoleic acid, DPPH free radical scavenging, ABTS cation radical scavenging, CUPRAC reducing power, and metal chelating activity methods. The cytotoxic activity was determined by the MTT assay using human ovarian adenocarcinoma (Skov-3), glioblastoma (U87), human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cell lines. The antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts was tested on gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) using the in vitro minimum inhibition concentration method (MIC). Enzyme inhibition activity of R. acetosella methanol extract was measured spectrophotometrically against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes. Results: The findings showed that the major components of the methanol extract content were luteolin-7-O-glucoside (1.599 m/L), polydatin (91,024 m/L), and shikimic acid (0.773 m/L). It was determined that the extract and standard antioxidant (a-tocopherol) results in DPPH center dot, and ABTS center dot + tests performed to determine the antioxidant activity were close to each other, and this value was more effective than the standard antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol) in the CUPRAC test. These results suggested that the plant's antioxidant potential was higher when compared with reference antioxidant compounds. It was determined that the methanol extract of R. acetosella had a weaker effect on the growth of the tested microorganisms than the antibiotics used as standard. The activity of the GST and AChE enzymes was found to be severely inhibited by the methanol extract of R. acetosella.

The present study was dedicated to the analysis of mineral and chemical composition and evaluation of antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties of aqueous and organic extracts of Leopoldia comosa, a plant with a long history of therapeutic and food use. Mineral content was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Chemical composition was carried out by extraction of essential oils, preparation of aqueous and organic extracts, and qualitative and quantitative analysis. The biological study consisted of the evaluation of antidiabetic activity by inhibition of three enzymes, antioxidant activity by five tests, and antibacterial activity by the disc diffusion method. The correlation between chemical composition and antidiabetic and antioxidant properties was explored by PCA. The results showed that L. comosa contains high levels of Fe, K, P, Na, Cu, Mg, and Ca with values, respectively, in the order of 33552, 1843.14, 756.36, 439.65, 303.9, 272.37, and 20.55 mg/kg.

The purpose of this work was to analyze for the first time water and ethanol extracts obtained from young, freshly developed, leaves and stems of the European dewberry to determine their antioxidant and biological activity, whereas most of the papers describe biological properties of leaves collected during summer or autumn. As the phytochemical profile changes during the growing season, the quantitative and qualitative content of flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid aglycones was analyzed using reversed phase liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The ability to inhibit hyaluronidase as well as antioxidant activity (2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl: DPPH and ferric antioxidant power: FRAP) were estimated. Extracts were also analyzed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results of the qualitative phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of flavonoid aglycones and flavonoid glycosides, with the highest amount of tiliroside, hyperoside, isoquercetin, astragalin, rutin and catechin in ethanol extracts. DPPH and FRAP tests proved the high antioxidant activity of the extracts from leaves or stems and the antihyaluronidase assay revealed for the first time that water and ethanol extracts obtained from the stems exhibited the ability to inhibit hyaluronidase activity resulting in an IC50 of 55.24 +/- 3.21 and 68.7 +/- 1.61 mu g/mL, respectively.

Nine extracts obtained from flowers, stems and leaves and bulbs and bulblets of A. roseum var. grandiflorum were tested for their total phenol, total flavonoid and total flavonol content. All these extracts and the essential oils from fresh stems, leaves and flowers were screened for their possible antioxidant and antifungal properties. The results showed that the hexadecanoic acid was detected as the major component of the leaf essential oil (75.9%). The ethyl acetate extract of stems and leaves had the highest antioxidant activity with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.35 +/- 0.01 mg/mL of DPPH and 0.71 +/- 0.01 mg/mL of ABTS(center dot+). All the extracts appeared to be able to inhibit most of the tested fungi. The essential oil of the leaves had an antifungal growth effect on Fusarium solani f. sp. cucurbitae and Botrytis cinerea (39.13 and 52.50%, respectively). This could be attributed to the presence of hexadecanoic acid, known for its strong antifungal activity.

Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water were used as solvents to obtain the corresponding extracts. A GC-MS analysis was employed to reveal the chemical composition of hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate fractions. Conventional and ultrasound-assisted water extraction was performed to isolate inulin-type polysaccharides. Eighteen microorganisms were used for testing the antimicrobial activity of the obtained organic extracts. From GC-MS analysis more than forty compounds were detected in the fractions, including fatty acids, organic acids, fatty alcohols, sterols, and terpenes. Only in ethyl acetate extract were found mannitol and fructose isomers, while in chloroform extract were detected alpha- and beta-amyrin, and betulin. Ethyl acetate fraction demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against 11 microorganisms (Bacillus cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Saccharomices cerevisiae, and Peniclium sp.).

Ethanol root bark extracts consistently showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (62.43%), total phenol content (TPH) (57.6226 mg GAE/g) and reducing power (RP) (41.32%), followed by those of the stem bark and leaf extracts with the respective values of 54.68%, 37.77 mg GAE/g and 21.83%. The extracts induced the leakage of Na+ and K+ ions from both test bacteria. Conclusion: Curtisia dentata is a very effective source of antioxidant and a possible alternative to sourcing antiverotoxic antibiotics with novel mechanism of action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, during the processing of stigmas, large amounts of floral bio-residues are normally discarded as by-products. In this study, using untargeted metabolomics, the comprehensive phytochemical composition of C. sativus stigma and tepals was investigated. Moreover, the antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties of the extracts of C. sativus stigmas and tepals were compared. The study was carried out using two methicillin-resistant staphylococcal reference strains (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984), representing important Gram-positive biofilm-forming human pathogens. The antibacterial properties were correlated with total polyphenol content, total terpenoid content, and in vitro antioxidant properties of tepals and stigmas. The results demonstrated that stigma and tepal extracts, at the sub-toxic concentrations, were able to interfere with biofilm formation by ATCC 43300 and ATCC 35984. Besides, the higher antibacterial activity of tepals than stigmas was associated with higher levels of phycompounds. Therefore, our results demonstrated that C. sativus stigmas and bio-residues, such as tepals, are potential antioxidant sources and good candidates as antibacterial agents to prevent biofilm formation.

Janch (or Nanorrhinum ramosissimum (Wall.) Betsche is a well-known medicinal plant in Pakistan that is traditionally used in diabetic and inflammatory conditions. Because little information is available on its phytochemical composition, a range of constituents were isolated and evaluated in vitro in assays related to the traditional use. Methods: Dried whole plant material was extracted and chromatographically fractionated. Isolated constituents were evaluated in silico and in vitro in assays related to the traditional use against diabetes (inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity; inhibition of advanced glycation endproducts) and in inflammatory conditions (inhibition of AAPH induced linoleic acid peroxidation, inhibition of 15-LOX, antimicrobial activity). Results: Phytochemical analysis of the extracts and fractions led to isolation of 7 compounds, including the iridoids kickxiasine (being a new compound), mussaenosidic acid, mussaenoside and linarioside; the flavonoids pectolinarigenin and pectolinarin; and 4-hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester. The iridoids showed weak antiglycation activity. The flavonoids, however, showed interesting results as pectolinarigenin was highly active compared to pectolinarin. In the alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay, only weak activity was observed for the iridoids. However, the flavonoid pectolinarigenin showed good activity, followed by pectolinarin. In the 15-LOX experiment, moderate inhibition was recorded for most compounds, the iridoids mussaenosidic acid and mussaenoside being the most active. In the AAPH assay, weak or no inhibition was recorded for all compounds. The in silico assays for the alpha-glucosidase and 15-LOX assays confirmed the results of respective in vitro assays. Pectolinarigenin showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Plasmodium falciparum K1, and Trypanosoma cruzi, but it was not cytotoxic on a human MRC-5 cell line.

Antioxidant activity was evaluated by radical scavenging assay and phosphomolybdenic assay. Total phenolics and flavonoids were estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and aluminium chloride method. The antimicrobial screenings were carried out via disc diffusion method and minimal inhibition concentration against three species of gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli CCM 3988, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica CCM 3807, Yersinia enterocolitica CCM 5671 and three grampositive bacteria: Bacillus thuringiensis CCM 19, Listeria monocytogenes CCM 4699, Stapylococcus aureus subsp. aereus CCM 2461. All the plants tested had some antioxidant activity. Parkia africana had the highest antioxidant activity values of 47.99 mu g TEAC/g and 1036.56 mu g TEAC/g in the DPPH center dot and phosphomolybdenum assays respectively; along with the highest amount of total flavonoids (0.165 mu g QE/g). The inhibition zones against three gram-negative strains of different tested plants were ranged from 10-24 mm. From our results the Parkia africana extract showed the strongest action against E. coli (24 mm), S. enterica subsp. enterica (21 mm) and Y. enterocolitica (22 mm). The minimum inhibitory affect of plants ranged from 16 to 256 mu g/ml. The best antibacterial activity was found at Parkia africana against gramnegative bacteria strains.

Despite the great interest in plants of this genus, there are few reports on the antioxidant and biological activities of preparations obtained from the leaves of these plants. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the antioxidant activity of preparations from leaves of wild plant species of the genus Rubus using the frequently applied DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods, as well as to determine the total polyphenol content using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and perform qualitative evaluation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The bactericidal and fungicidal activities of the obtained preparations were evaluated by applying laboratory tests: using the disc and the well methods based on the standards EN 13697:2019, EN 13697:2015, and EN 1500:2013. Microbiological tests of the plant preparations against bacteria, fungi, and yeasts isolated from the environment and against reference strains were performed. Moreover, antimicrobial testing of antibiotics against the tested strains was performed for comparison. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient of the obtained preparations was determined by the shake-flask method to determine their lipophilicity. According to the results, a high content of polyphenols and other antioxidant and biologically active compounds can be thought of as the parameter responsible for the effective activity of plant preparations obtained from wild plant species of the genus Rubus. The methods for determining bactericidal and fungicidal activity clearly demonstrates that preparations with reduced ethanol content exhibit bactericidal and fungicidal activity on surfaces. Testing of hand disinfection by means of rubbing with the preparations confirmed their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli K12 NCTC 10538. The obtained results show that the tested preparations exhibit on average two times lower activity against the reference bacterial strains than comparable antibiotics. The preparations obtained from the leaves of R. idaeus L. and R. fruticosus L. could complement classical antibiotics. While environmental bacteria showed a similar response to the preparations and antibiotics, their sensitivity was about one-third less than that of the reference strains. Our studies have shown that the obtained preparations are highly hydrophilic (logP < 0).

Plants are an important source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including novel antimicrobials that are urgently needed due to the global spread of drug-resistant bacteria and fungi. Here, we tested different extracts of chicory for a range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal and cytotoxicity assays. Antibacterial and antifungal activities were generally more potent in ethyl acetate extracts compared to water extracts, whereas supercritical fluid extracts showed the broadest range of bioactivities in our assays. Remarkably, the chicory supercritical fluid extract and a purified fraction thereof inhibited both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and ampicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa IBRS P001. Chicory extracts also showed higher antibiofilm activity against the yeast Candida albicans than standard sesquiterpene lactone compounds. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was generally low.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of different rates of applied nitrogen (N) and timing (early and late) of N application on yield, chemical composition, pharmacologic activity, and cytotoxicity of bush tea. Factorial treatments consisted of timed N application rates (0, 75, 150, and 225 kg.ha(-1)) for both early and late N application. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replicates. The results show a significant positive response of bush tea fresh and dry leaf and twig weight, chlorophyll, leaf tissue N, total polyphenols, and total flavonoids in response to applied N rates, regardless of the timing of N application, reaching a maximum at 225 kg.ha(-1) of N. Later, regardless of the timing of N application, total tannins and total antioxidant activity increased with increasing applied N from 0 to 225 kg.ha(-1), reaching a maximum of 150 kg.ha(-1) N. The results of this study suggest that, with the exception of antimicrobial activity, most of the parameters recorded increased with increasing rates of N applied. The results further denote that parameters recorded were consistently greater on early applied N compared with late applied N. However, there was no significant difference between the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicide concentration (MMC) of early and late applied N. Bush tea applied with 75 N and 150 N had a significant MIC value (3.1 mg.mL(-1)) for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia compared with 6.3 mg.mL(-1) reached at 225 kg.ha(-1) N. Among N rates applied, the MIC for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescence, and Staphylococcus aureus were not significantly different. Hence, N rates applied did not have a significant effect on bush tea MMC values of all microbial species tested. The cytotoxicity of bush tea leaf and twigs harvested from early and late N application were significantly reduced with increasing nitrogen levels reaching a maximum at 225 kg.ha(-1). There was a wide variation of compounds despite rates of N applied as well as timing of application, with most compounds such as norfenfluramine, phytol, caryophyllene, propylene glycol, alpha-copaene, and squalene detected in greater quantities.",HORTSCIENCE,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,antimicrobial activity; antioxidant activity; biomass; chemical composition; cytotoxicity,CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; POTASSIUM NUTRITION; PLANT-EXTRACTS; ESSENTIAL OIL; FERTILIZER; GROWTH; PHOSPHORUS; QUALITY; L.,"[Tshivhandekano, Itani; Mudau, Fhatuwani Nixwell] Univ South Africa, Dept Agr & Anim Hlth, Private Bag X6, ZA-1710 Florida, South Africa; [Tshikalange, Thilivhali Emmanuel] Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant Sci, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",Athrixia phylicoides,,Asteraceae,,"phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, noise","phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, noise","Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris","positive, negative, negative, negative",,Athrixia phylicoides,Asteraceae,Athrixia,South Africa

These health activities are owed to the unique phytochemical components present in pomegranate peels. Variations in the pomegranate cultivar, geographical region, and extraction methods significantly affect the phytochemical composition and concentrations of pomegranate fruits and their peels, hence their health outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the phytochemical contents of pomegranate peels of Jordanian origin and their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Among the 6 extracts of pomegranate peels tested, the ethanol extract exhibited the highest total phenolic content (TPC = 297.70 +/- 1.73 mg GAE/g DW), highest total flavonoids content (TFC = 116.08 +/- 3.46 mg RE/g DW), highest hydrolyzable tannins (HT) contents (688.50 +/- 3.54 mg TE/g DW). Whereas the highest condensed tannins (CT) content was found in both the ethanol (13.87 +/- 0.58 mg CE/g DW) and methanol (13.84 +/- 0.55 mg CE/g DW) extracts. For the antioxidant activities, the water extract of pomegranate peels displayed the highest inhibitory effect on DPPH radicals (9.43 +/- 0.06 mu mole TE/g DW), while for the ABTS(+) assay the methanol and ethanol extracts exhibited the highest activities of 11.09 +/- 0.02 and 11.09 +/- 0.06 mu mole TE/g DW, respectively. For the FRAP assay, the aqueous methanol extract exhibited the highest reducing activity (1.60 +/- 0.09 mmole Fe (II)/g DW). As for the antimicrobial activities of various extracts of pomegranate peels, the highest antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus was achieved by the ethanol extract (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL), whereas the lowest antimicrobial activity was observed against Candida krusei using the methanol extract (MIC = 100 mg/mL).

In order to potentially adapt the extracts of this plant's raw material for therapeutic purposes, it is important to carry out detailed studies on the chemical composition and biological activity of balsam poplar buds. An important step is to evaluate the yield of polyphenols by different extraction methods and using different solvents. According to our research, extracts of balsam poplar buds collected in Lithuania are dominated by p-coumaric (496.9-13,291.2 mu g/g), cinnamic acid (32.9-11,788.5 mu g/g), pinobanksin (34.9-1775.5 mu g/g) and salicin (215.3-1190.7 mu g/g). The antioxidant activity of poplar buds was evaluated by the ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant power) methods, all extracts showed antioxidant activity and the obtained results correlated with the obtained amounts of total phenolic compounds in the extracts (ABTS r = 0.974; DPPH r = 0.986; FRAP r = 0.955, p < 0.01).

The Soxhlet (Sox), Bligh-Dyer (BD), and ultrasound (US) methods were used for extractions. For blackberry non-polar seed extract, extraction via the BD method showed the highest mean values of total phenolic content (TPC), expressed in milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per 100 mL of non-polar seed extracts (102.37 mg GAE/100 mL), and higher antioxidant activity in relation to the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, expressed in milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per 100 mL of non-polar seed extracts (11.50 mg AAE/100 mL), if compared with the Sox and US extractions. Similar results were obtained for the non-polar grape seed extracts, where BD extraction obtained the highest values for TPC (28.61 mg GAE/100 mL) and DPPH (35.36 mg AAE/100 mL). The type of extraction method had an impact on the composition of fatty acids. Only the non-polar blackberry and grape seed extracts obtained via the Sox method showed some in vitro inhibitory effect against Escherichia coli (IAL 2064) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 13565). Regardless of the extraction method used, the non-polar blackberry and grape seed extracts did not decrease the cell viability (IC50 >1000 mu g/mL) of cancer and normal cell lines, thus indicating the relative safety of the extracts.

The present study examined the ethanol extract of turmeric for its chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, and free radical scavenging properties. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis tentatively identified eight compounds in the turmeric extract. Potential antimicrobial effects of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg turmeric equivalents (TE)/mL were evaluated in vitro against a variety of Gram-negative bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas sp.) and Gram-positive bacteria (i.e., Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Staphylococcus aureus). Concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg TE/mL inhibited the growth of S. aureus and significantly suppressed that of Pseudomonas sp., E. faecalis, and L. innocua. The growth of all strains, including E. coli, was inhibited by 10 mg TE/mL. Moreover, free radical scavenging capacities were determined using HO center dot, ABTS(center dot+), and DPPH center dot (HOSC, ABTS, and RDSC, respectively) radicals. The turmeric ethanol extract had a TPC value of 27.12 mg GAE/g, together with HOSC, RDSC, and ABTS values of 1524.59, 56.38, and 1.70 mu mol TE/g, respectively.

However, there is a lack of information on the medicinal uses of plants in many of the interior Himalayan regions. In light of this, the current investigation was initiated in the tribally dominant western Himalayan hinterland. The current study examined five underutilized wild edible plants, namely, Allium rubellum, Berberis chitria, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stellaria aquatica, and Rheum emodi, for their nutritional qualities, phytochemical analysis, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity, which are consumed as food by the Gaddi community of the Bharmour region of the Chamba District, Himachal Pradesh. In this study, the nutritional makeup of these plants was examined in terms of their carbohydrate, protein, sodium, potassium, crude fiber, and fat content. As compared to other investigated species, A. rubellum has the highest nutritional content: carbohydrate (6.93 mg/g), protein (10.18 mg/g), sodium (3.21 mg/g), potassium (16.32 mg/g), and fiber (6.46%). In addition, phenols, amino acids, tannins, terpenoids, carotenoids, and phytate were found to be the least significant phytochemicals in R. emodi, i.e., 4.81 mg/g, 0.594 mg/g, 2.204 mg/g, 1.482 mg/g, 156 mu g/g, and 0.680%, respectively. The methanolic extract of these wild edible plants showed significant free radical scavenging activity by using ABTS and DPPH assays. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract of studied plants based on the present study suggested that R. emodi exhibits a maximum zone of inhibition of 20.8 mm against Escherichia coli, whereas S. aquatica showed a maximum inhibition zone of 19.2 mm against S. aureus. The findings of this study validated that these wild edible plants are an alternate source of medicine and are an abundant source of various phytochemicals like protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.

The evaluation of in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity as well as chemical characterization of Acacia seyal bark water and methanolic extracts were presented. The water extract has a toxicity against the MRC-5 cells at 256 mu g/mL while the methanolic extract has a weak toxicity at the same concentration. The methanolic extract has a strong antioxidant activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 150 +/- 2.2 mu g/mL using 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and IC50 of 27 +/- 1.3 mu g/mL using 2,2 ' -azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical methods.

Rambutan fruit is nutritious and rich in vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds that offer many health benefits. The research on the potential of N. lappaceum for pharmaceutical use is underestimated. This study aims to determine the phytochemical constituents and unravel the potential of leaf extracts for antibacterial activity. Mature leaves of five cultivars of N. lappaceum (R191, R3, S1, AG28, and GB44) were extracted using two different solvents (methanol and water) and these extracts were subjected to phytochemical screening. The effects of crude leaf extract on antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus dan the Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli were conducted using the agar well diffusion method. The methanol extraction method recorded a higher yield than the water extraction method in all tested cultivars with AG 28 recording the highest percentage of 28.2%. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of coumarins, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, and tannins in both methanolic and water leaf extracts. Alkaloids were only present in the water extracts except for R191, while no detection of anthocyanin presence in both methanolic and water extracts. Analysis of antibacterial activity based on the zone of inhibition growth for methanolic and water extracts of five different cultivars showed significant antibacterial effects (p<0.05) p <0.05) with methanolic extract being the most effective against S. aureus and E. coli with the highest inhibition zones of 39 (+/- 0.3) mm and 29 (+/- 0.6) mm, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value was 1.25 % w/v for R3, AG28, and GB44 in methanolic extracts against E. coli and the lowest MIC (1.25% w/v) was recorded for AG28 in methanolic extracts against S. aureus. .

In this study, we investigate the antibacterial potential of Moroccan Allium sativum L. essential oil (EO) through both in vitro and in silico approaches. The EO was extracted using hydrodistillation, and its physicochemical properties were analyzed alongside its chemical composition via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We assessed antibacterial efficacy through disk diffusion assays targeting Escherichia coli ( E. coli), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Finally, an in silico molecular docking analysis and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) prediction were performed. Our analysis identified 13 sulfur-based compounds within the EO, with diallyl disulfide (42.85 %), methylallyl disulfide (18.84 %), methylallyl trisulfide (15.38 %), and diallyl trisulfide (13.11 %) as major constituents. The EO demonstrated robust activity against MRSA, with an inhibition zone of 22 mm and an MIC of 0.75 mg/mL, whereas E. coli exhibited lower sensitivity, with an MIC of 1.51 mg/mL. Molecular docking analysis suggested that the primary sulfur compounds may effectively inhibit bacterial resistance-related enzymes. These findings highlight the potential of Allium sativum L.

Followed by a phytochemical study on the aqueous extract of S. lavandulifolia leaves, namely phytochemical screening and determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins contents. Then, the biological activities were undertaken, in particular the antioxidant activity (total antioxidant activity and trapping of the DPPH degrees radical) and the antimicrobial activity. The chemical composition of this extract was also determined by HPLC-MS-ESI. Finally, the inhibitory effect of the alpha-amylase enzyme as well as the antihyperglycaemic effect was evaluated in vivo in normal rats overloaded with starch or D-glucose. The aqueous extract obtained by use of the decoction of leaves of S. lavandulifolia contains 246.51 +/- 1.69 mg EQ of gallic acid/g DE, 23.80 +/- 0.12 mg EQ quercetin/g DE, and 2.46 +/- 0.08 mg EQ catechin /g DE. Its total antioxidant capacity is around 527.03 +/- 5.95 mg EQ of ascorbic acid/g DE. At a concentration of 5.81 +/- 0.23 mu g/mL, our extract was able to inhibit 50% of DPPH degrees radicals. Moreover, it showed bactericidal effect against Proteus mirabilis, fungicidal against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and fungistatic against Candida krusei. A marked antihyperglycemic activity (AUC = 54.84 +/- 4.88 g/L/h), as well as a significant inhibitory effect of alpha-amylase in vitro (IC50 = 0.99 +/- 0.00 mg/mL) and in vivo (AUC = 51.94 +/- 1.29 g/L/h), is recorded in our extract. Furthermore, its chemical composition reveals the presence of 37.03% rosmarinic acid, 7.84% quercetin rhamnose, 5.57% diosmetin-rutinoside, 5.51% catechin dimer, and 4.57% gallocatechin as major compounds. The antihyperglycemic and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities, associated with the antioxidant properties of S. lavandulifolia, justify its use in the treatment of diabetes in traditional medicine and highlight its potential introduction into antidiabetic drugs.",PHARMACEUTICALS,MDPI,Salvia lavandilufolia Vahl; diabetes; alpha-amylase; antioxidant; antimicrobial activity; quality control,ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE; PLANT POLYPHENOLS; L.; FLAVONOIDS; ACID; PREVENTION; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; LUTEOLIN,"[Remok, Firdaous; Saidi, Soukaina; Gourich, Aman Allah; Zibouh, Khalid; Makhoukhi, Fadwa El; Touijer, Hanane; Bouhrim, Mohamed; Zair, Touriya] Moulay Ismail Univ, Fac Sci, Lab Innovat Mat & Biotechnol Nat Resources, Res Team Chem Bioact Mol & Environm, Meknes 50070, Morocco; [Saidi, Soukaina] Sultan Moulay Slimane Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Lab Mol Chem Mat & Catalysis, Beni Mellal 23000, Morocco; [Maouloua, Mohamed] Med V Prov Med Ctr, Lab Med Biol, Meknes 50000, Morocco; [Makhoukhi, Fadwa El] Natl Ctr Sci & Tech Res, Rabat 10000, Morocco; [Menyiy, Naoual El] Natl Agcy Med & Aromat Plants, Lab Pharmacol, Taounate 34025, Morocco; [Sahpaz, Sevser] Univ Lille, Univ Liege, Univ Artois,UPJV,ULCO, ICV Inst Charles Viollette,Joint Res Unit BioEcoAg, F-59000 Lille, France; [Salamatullah, Ahmad Mohammad] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Bourhia, Mohammed] Ibn Zohr Univ, Fac Med & Pharm, Lab Chem & Biochem, Laayoune 70000, Morocco",Salvia lavandulifolia,,Lamiaceae,,"isolated compounds, tannins, phenolics, noise, isolated compounds, flavonoids","isolated compounds, tannins, phenolics, noise, isolated compounds, flavonoids",Proteus mirabilis,negative,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Candida tropicalis",Salvia lavandulifolia,Lamiaceae,Salvia,Morocco

The present work describes the chemical composition of essential oil of P. carolinensis leaves and flowers from Martinique Island and first exploration of its antimicrobial and insecticide activities. The chemical analysis using GC/FID and GC-MS of essential oils of P. carolinensis flowers and leaves led to the identification of 44 constituents representing 64.6-84.2 % of the extracts. The major identified components in aerial parts were selin-11-en-4 alpha-ol (17.7-33.4 %), beta-caryophyllene (5.5-21.1 %), 2,5-dimethoxycymene (8.9-3.3 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.6-3.3 %), alpha-pinene (4.7 %) and spathulenol (3.8-3.1 %). Furthermore, two carvotanacetone derivatives were for the first time identified from the aerial parts of P. carolinensis: 5-angeloyloxycarvotagetone (2.9-18.1 % of abundance in oils) and the new carvotanacetone 5-isovaleroyloxycarvotagetone (1.2-7.0 % of abundance in oils). Their structures were elucidated based on NMR and HRMS data. Essential oil of P. carolinensis exhibited an antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Insecticidal assays against Aedes aegypti showed an interesting repellent activity at 1.0 % and a high irritating activity at 0.1 % against mosquitoes. Thus the essential oil from P. carolinensis aerial parts can be considered as new source of natural ingredient for pharmaceutical and cosmetical industries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We extracted P. suberosa leaves under reflux conditions using different solvents (hexane, chloroform, methanol and water), then subjected to phytochemical screening, Alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins and saponins and anthraquinones were present in hexane and chloroform extracts. Alkaloids, unsaturated sterols, triterpenes, saponins, flavonoids and tannins were observed in both methanol and aqueous extracts. Proanthocyanidins were observed only in the aqueous extract, Hence, aqueous and methanol extracts with most classes of phytochemicals present were subjected to antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihaemolytic activities and Brine shrimp lethality studies. Antibacterial activity and minimum inhibition concentrations were evaluated using three Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudumonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimuriam and Escherichia coli),I The results indicated that only the methanol extract of P. suberosa exhibited antibacterial activities against all the strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial with stronger activity against Gram-negative bacteria. DPHH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazy) scavenging assay was adopted to evaluate antioxidant properties while antihaemolytic and toxic activities were studied respectively using cow blood and Brine shrimp lethality assay.

However, the peels of these fruits, which are rich in phytochemicals and sustainable components for innovative culinary formulations, are often discarded as waste. Methods: This study explored the phytochemistry and valorization of three melon fruit, i.e., canary melon (Cucumis melo, var. Fonzy), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus, var. Augusta), and muskmelon (Cucumis melo, var. Cantaloupe), peels in food applications by incorporating into wheat flour biscuits. Peels of fruits were separated, dried and powders were extracted with 70% ethanol. Results and discussion: Comparing the muskmelon fruit peel to the peels of the other two fruits, the muskmelon fruit peel had the significantly (p < 0.05) high ash (8.36%), fiber (12.06%), fat (1.21%), protein (5.02%), mineral contents (Mg 233, Ca 364, K 1605, Fe 49.72, and Zn 2.39 mg/100 g), total phenolic content (167.49 mg GAE/100 g), total flavonoid content (79.16 mg QE/100 g) and total antioxidant activity (56.92 mg Trolox equivalent/100 g). Results of the antimicrobial experiments of three melon peels showed that extracts from all peels showed enough antimicrobial activities, nearly comparable to the reference drugs (ampicillin and nystatin), which still showed the highest inhibition zones. Among three extracts, highest zone of inhibition against three bacterial species, i.e., Bacillus cereus (12.03 mm), Escherichia coli (10.02 mm), and Streptococcus aureus (18.08 mm), and fungal species, i.e., Candida albicans (8.09 mm), Aspergillus niger (7.06 mm), and Mucor meihi (7.02 mm) was exhibited by muskmelon peel extract. Moisture, ash, fat, fiber, minerals, phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant activities of biscuits were increased as a result of incorporating peel flours. Correlation showed TPC and TAA were highly correlated in watermelon (10%; 1). Using principal component analysis, adding 5% canary watermelon peel powder to biscuits improved their healthful and active elements while maintaining sensory features. Baking with 10% muskmelon or watermelon peel powder boosted nutrition and antioxidant activity. After the control, biscuits fortified with 5% melon peel powder exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) high sensory scores.

However, the antimicrobial and antioxidant actions of A. unedo and its bioactive compounds have not been well studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Arbutus unedo roots extracts and to investigate the action of their major compounds. Methods: The roots were exhaustively extracted by high-pressure static extraction using the Zippertex (R) technology, with different solvents (water, methanol, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane). The antioxidant activity of A. unedo root extracts were examined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging and FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) procedures. The root extracts were tested against four reference health-damaging bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the agar well diffusion and broth dilution assays. Results: The results of this study showed that ethyl acetate extract of A. unedo roots have the highest contents of phenols and flavonoids with a value of 590.31 +/- 17.62 mg GAE/g extract and 47.42 +/- 1.80 mg RE/g extract, respectively. Moreover, the same extract exhibited the most potent antioxidant activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and half maximal effective concentration (EC50) doses of 0.02 +/- 0.01 and 0.15 +/- 0.01 mg/mL, respectively. This result is similar to those showed by ascorbic acid and quercetin. According to the broth microdilution method, the methanolic plant extract revealed the highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 12.5 mg/mL. This extract was most effective against S. aureus (inhibitory zone=15.4 +/- 0.2 mm), E. coli (inhibitory zone=12.2 +/- 0.2 mm), and Salmonella (inhibitory zone=10.2 +/- 0.1 mm) as revealed in the disc diffusion assay. The antibacterial activity of the extracts confirmed by the predicted results of molecular docking studies, and same amino acids in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme interact with both catechin and reference adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in similar modes. Conclusion: The present data suggest that A. unedo the root extracts have potential antioxidant activity and antibacterial effect against selected bacterial strains, which may have a potential therapeutic use against oxidative stress related pathologies and infectious diseases.

Their health benefits, particularly from the seed oils, could be attributed to the presence of a variety of bioactive components. Roasting is a critical process that has historically been used to facilitate oil extraction and enhance flavor; it may also alter the chemical composition and biological properties of the Nigella seed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the roasting process on the composition of the bioactive components and the biological activities of Nigella arvensis and Nigella sativa seed extracts. Our preliminary study showed that seeds roasted at 50 degrees C exhibited potent antimicrobial activities; therefore, this temperature was selected for roasting Nigella seeds. For extraction, raw and roasted seed samples were macerated in methanol. The antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were determined by measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition. The cell viability of extracts was tested in a colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, by using a microculture tetrazolium technique (MTT) assay. Amino acids were extracted and quantified using an automatic amino acid analyzer. Then, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed to identify the chemical constituents and fatty acids. As a result, the extracts of raw and roasted seeds in both Nigella species showed strong inhibition against Klebsiella oxytoca, and the raw seed extract of N. arvensis demonstrated moderate inhibition against S. pyogenes. The findings of the MTT assay indicated that all the extracts significantly decreased cancer cell viability. Moreover, N. sativa species possessed higher contents of the measured amino acids, except tyrosine, cystine, and methionine. The GC-MS analysis of extracts showed the presence of 22 and 13 compounds in raw and roasted N. arvensis, respectively, and 9 and 11 compounds in raw and roasted N. sativa, respectively. However, heat treatment decreased the detectable components to 13 compounds in roasted N. arvensis and increased them in roasted N. sativa.

Its main bioactive compound hypoxoside (HYP) and its aglycone derivative rooperol (RO) were isolated and the interaction of these compounds with several types of model membranes was studied in order to contribute to the understanding of their molecular mechanism. The results show that RO abolishes the main transition phase and perturb the van der Waals interactions between phospholipid acyl chains in a stronger way than HYP in dimiristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), diclaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DEPE) and dimiristoylphosphatidylglycerol membranes (DMPG), probably indicating that this molecule inserts into the bilayer. This effect decreases as the acyl chain length of the phospholipid increases. RO also promoted the formation of hexagonal HI, phases at lower temperatures compared to pure DEPE. On the contrary, HYP showed a shallow interaction with phospholipids. This compound promoted the formation of gel-fluid like intermediate structures with isotropic motion in phosphatidylglycerol membranes at physiological pH, and affected the phospholipid/water interface probably through the variation of the surface charge of the phospholipid phosphate groups. Moreover, RO inhibited Staphylococcus aureus in a stronger manner than Escherichia coli and promoted a higher leakage level in E. coli, PG and PE-containing synthetic membranes. Furthermore, RO showed a significant degree of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) evidencing an approximate COX-2/COX-1 IC50 ratio of 1.9, therefore this compound may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of H. rooperi corm extract. These results may contribute to understand the molecular mechanism of the antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory properties of the bioactive compounds deriving from the African potato corm extract.

Some holly species, such as Ilex paraguariensis (widely known in the form of popular beverage: yerba mate), have been investigated, while others have been partially researched or remain unknown. Therefore, we performed qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses and screened antimicrobial properties of lesser-studied species (I. aquifolium L., I. aquifolium 'Argentea Marginata' and I. x meserveae 'Blue Angel'). I. paraguariensis was used as a standard species for comparison purposes. Investigations were performed on water extracts due to their expected activity and composition. Antimicrobial research included evaluating minimal inhibitory, bactericidal (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and fungicidal concentration (Candida albicans, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, and Aspergillus niger) of extracts. The influence of the extracts on the production, eradication, and viability of bacterial biofilms was also analysed. It was established that Ilex paraguariensis possesses the richest profile of hydroxycinnamic acids derivatives in terms of component concentration and diversity. Ilex spp., especially I. x meserveae, contain a slightly higher amount of flavonoids and more different flavonoid derivatives than I. paraguariensis. However, the strongest antibacterial activity was shown by I. aquifolium L. and its cultivar 'Argentea Marginata' in terms of minimal inhibitory, bactericidal and fungicidal concentration, and biofilm assays. Extracts from both species significantly reduced the biofilm viability of S. aureus as well, which may be of use in the production of multicomponent lavaseptics, antiseptics, diuretics (supporting urinary tract infection therapy) and, due to their action on fungi, additives to growth media for specific fungi. The significant content of saponins enables Ilex extracts to be used as natural emulsifiers, for example, in cosmetics. Moreover, relatively high chlorogenic acid and rutin content may suggest use of Ilex spp. to treat obesity, digestive problems, in chemoprevention, and as preservatives in the food industry.",MOLECULES,MDPI,Ilex; antimicrobial activity; biofilm; HPLC; DAD; MS; polyphenols; yerba mate,YERBA MATE; ST-HIL.; ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; AQUEOUS EXTRACT; PARAGUARIENSIS; IDENTIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; CONSTITUENTS; PLANTS,"[Paluch, Emil; Duda-Madej, Anna] Wroclaw Med Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Chalubinskiego 4, PL-50376 Wroclaw, Poland; [Okinczyc, Piotr; Wlodarczyk, Maciej] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Pharmacognosy & Herbal Med, Borowska 211a, PL-50556 Wroclaw, Poland; [Zwyrzykowska-Wodzinska, Anna; Kupczynski, Robert] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Environm Hyg & Anim Welf, Chelmonskiego 38C, PL-51630 Wroclaw, Poland; [Szperlik, Jakub] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biol Sci, Lab Tissue Culture Bot Garden, Sienkiewicza 23, PL-50525 Wroclaw, Poland; [Zarowska, Barbara] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Chelmonskiego 37, PL-51630 Wroclaw, Poland; [Babelewski, Przemyslaw] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Hort, Grunwaldzki 24A, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Wojtasik, Wioleta] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biotechnol, Przybyszewskiego 63-77, PL-51148 Wroclaw, Poland; [Szumny, Antoni] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Chem, Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland",Ilex,,Aquifoliaceae,,"saponins, flavonoids, flavonoids","saponins, flavonoids, flavonoids","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative","Fusarium oxysporum, Candida albicans, Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger",Ilex,Aquifoliaceae,Ilex,Poland

Bio-ferments obtained from this plant are becoming increasingly useful as active ingredients in cosmetics. In the present study, four different bio-ferments were obtained by fermentation of pomace (B-P), extract (B-E), oil (B-O), and seeds (B-S) of milk thistle. Their biodegradability (%B), total polyphenols content (Folin-Ciocalteu method), and antimicrobial, antioxidant (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods), chelating (Fe2+ ions), and reduction (Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions) properties, as well as the acidity, were evaluated. The contact angle using the sessile drop method was assessed to investigate bio-ferments' impact on skin wettability. Finally, the content of selected phenolic acids in the Bs was evaluated using the HPLC method, while the lactic acid (LA) content was assessed using the GC-MS method. All bio-ferments were characterized by high polyphenols content (13.56 +/- 0.10-15.28 +/- 0.12 mmol GA/L B), chelating (0.08 +/- 0.01-0.17 +/- 0.01 mmol Fe2+/L B) and antioxidant activity (DPPH method, 2.41 +/- 0.01-3.53 +/- 0.01 mmol Tx/L B), and reducing Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions.

All were grown organically. The 2 herbs that showed the greatest biomass were T citriodorus (26.5 g/plant) and 0. basilicum var. Cinnamon (105 g/plant). For these, total flavonoids (TFL), total flavones and flavonols (TFF), and total flavanones and dihydroflavonols (TFDH) were also determined for their ethanol extracts. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential (AOP) and antibacterial activity were determined against foodborne bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). The highest TPH (36 mg chlorogenic acid equivalents per gram of fresh weight) was seen for T citriodorus collected in 2010.

The column chromatography of the MeOH extract of M. buchananii leaves followed by purification of different fractions led to the isolation of nine known flavonoids. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectrum analysis, and by comparison with those from the literature. The antibacterial activity was assessed by performing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the time-kill kinetic study while the antioxidant activity was determined by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. All of the extracts/compounds showed antibacterial activity against the strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative multi-drug resistance bacteria, Vibrio cholerae (causative agent of cholera) and Shigella flexneri (causative agent of shigellosis). Compounds 2 (MIC = 32 to 128 mu g/mL) and 6 (MIC = 16 to 64 mu g/mL) showed the largest antibacterial activities with the best MIC (16 mu g/mL) recorded with compound 6 on S. aureus.

Herbs and spices have offered an excellent, important and useful source of antimicrobial agents against many pathological infections. In the current study, the antimicrobial potency of fresh, naturally and commercial dried Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale extracts had been investigated against seven local clinical bacterial isolates such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus' epidermidis, and Serratia marcesnces by the agar disc diffusion method. All tested pathogens except P. aeruginosa and E. coli were most susceptible to ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A. sativum. Similarly, chloroform and diethyl ether extracts of Z officinale showed a greater zone of inhibition of tested pathogens except for P. aeruginosa and E. coli. We found that all extracts of A. sativum and Z. officinale have a strong antibacterial effect compared to recommended standard antibiotics through activity index. All results were evaluated statistically and a significant difference was recorded at P< 0.05. Antioxidant activity of extracts showed that 10 out of 13 extracts have high scavenging potential. Thin layer chromatography profiling of all extracts of A. sativum and Z. officinale proposed the presence of various phytochemicals such as tannins, phenols, alkaloids, steroids and saponins. Retention factor of diverse phytochemicals provides a valuable clue regarding their polarity and the selection of solvents for separation of phytochemicals. Significant inhibition of S. aureus was also observed through TLC-Bioautography.

Brennan (Fabaceae) is used in traditional medicine to treat various human complaints including bronchitis, coughing, urino-genital ailments, meningitis, abdominal pain, treatment of wounds, malaria and gastrointestinal ailments, and is used as a purgative and worm expeller. Aim of the study: The present study describes the phytochemical investigation and the determination of the antimicrobial, antiplasmodial and antitrypanosomal activities of crude extract, fractions and compounds extracted from Piptadeniastrum africanum roots. Materials and methods: Isolated compounds were obtained using several chromatographic techniques. The structures of all compounds were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses (1D and 2D NMR) and by comparing their NMR data with those found in literature. In vitro antimicrobial activity of samples was evaluated using the microdilution method on bacterial (Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal (Candida krusei) strains, while in vitro cell-growth inhibition activities were assessed against two parasites (Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Plasmodium falcipantm strain 3D7). The cytotoxicity properties of samples were assayed against HeLa human cervical carcinoma. Results: Five compounds were isolated and identified as: tricosanol 1, 5 alpha-stigmasta 7,22 dien-3-beta-ol 2, betulinic acid 3, oleanolic acid 4 and piptadenamide 5. This is the first report of the isolation of these five compounds from the roots of P. africanum. The (Hex:EtOAc 50:50) fraction exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against P. mirabilis (MIC 250 mu g/mL), while the other fractions and isolated compounds had weak antimicrobial activities. Only the EtOAc fraction presented a moderate antimalarial activity with an IC50 of 16.5 mu g/mL. The Me0H crude extract and three fractions (Hexane, Hexane-EtOAc 25% and EtOAc-MeOH 25%) exhibited significant trypanocidal activity with IC50 values of 3.0, 37.5, 3.8 and 9.5 mu g/mL, respectively.

Chemical analyses of a crude methanol extract (CME) of Guiera senegalensis leaves revealed the presence of sugars, phospholipids, phytosterols, guieranone A, porphyrin-containing compounds, and phenolics. To connect chemical composition with biological effects, solid-phase extraction was used to discard water-soluble compounds with low affinity for the C18 matrix and obtain an ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) that concentrates guieranone A and chlorophylls, and a methanol fraction (MF) dominated by phenolics. While the CME and MF exhibited poor antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the EAF demonstrated antifungal activity against these filamentous fungi, particularly against C. gloeosporioides. Studies with yeasts revealed that the EAF has strong effectiveness against Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida krusei with MICs of 8, 8 and 16 mu g/mL, respectively. A combination of in vivo and in vitro studies shows that the EAF can function as a mitochondrial toxin, compromising complexes I and II activities, and as a strong inhibitor of fungal tyrosinase (Ki = 14.40 +/- 4.49 mu g/mL).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimize the ultrasonic aqueous extraction of phenols from P. equisetifome roots using Box-Behnken design based statistical modeling, and to evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial efficiencies of P. equisetifome root extracts against pathogenic bacteria. MethodsIn this study, the box-behnken design was used to optimize the extraction of phenols. The extraction temperature (30-70 degrees C), ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) time (1-9 min), and liquid-solid ratio (35-45 mL/g) were investigated as the factors that influence the phenolic yield (Y1) and their DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity (Y2). ResultsThe optimal conditions for both responses were 50 degrees C, 5 min, and 40 mL/g. At these conditions, Y1 reached its maximum to be 45.321 mg GAE/g dry weight and Y2 to be 120.354 mu mol Trolox/g dry weight. The P. equisetifome roots contained water soluble phenol, high anthocyanin, and condensed tannins.

Several species of fungi are reported on tomato fruit, causing damage both during cultivation and after harvest. Some of the appropriate actions that could be initiated to resolve the problem are to develop and search for new antimicrobial substances isolated from the bioactive natural products, such as essential oils. Aims and Objective: The aim of this work was to determine the chemical composition of essential oils of Ammoides verticillata, Allium sativum and Curcuma longa, to evaluate their in-vitro antifungal activities and in-vivo antifungal effect of essential oils to prevent the diseases caused by tomato. Materials and Methods: The essential oils obtained from aerial parts of plants were analyzed by GC/MS and tested for their antifungal activities against Penicillium expansum, Fusarium solani, Rhizopus stolonifer and Alternaria alternata using the radial growth technique method. The effectiveness in-vivo of the association between Allium sativum and Curcuma longa essential oils was also investigated on tomatoes inoculated by fungi. Results: The essential oil from A. verticilata was mainly composed of phenolic compounds (54.4%), the A. sativum oil was mainly composed of sulfur compounds (91.5%) and C. longa oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (82.0%). The obtained results in-vitro antifungal revealed that individual essential oils of A. verticillata and A. sativum were more active than the essential oil of C. longa against all screened microorganisms. An important antifungal effect of A. sativum and C. longa essential oils blend was obtained against P. expansum (100%), F. solani (95.2%), R. stolonifer (95.1%) and A. alternata (48.5%). Furthermore, A. sativum and C. longa essential oils blends have demonstrated promising in-vivo antifungal activity to control infection of tomato against P. expansum and R. stolonifer.

The yield percentage of extracts was calculated. Total Phenolic Content, Total Flavonoid Content, and antioxidant activity were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, Aluminium chloride colorimetric method, and DPPH (2,2 '-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay respectively. The quantification of fisetin and quercetin was performed using the HPLC with method validation. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against bacteria and fungus isolated from spoiled fruits and vegetables and identified through 16s and 18s rRNA sequencing. Finally, Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) was used for testing the toxicity of the extracts.ResultsThe phenolic and total flavonoid content was found to be higher in ethanol extract (331.84 mg GAE/g dry extract) and methanol extract (95.53 mg QE/g dry extract) from Kuleshwor respectively. Water extract of guava leaves from Kuleshwor (WGK) did not show significantly different antioxidant activity when compared to methanol and ethanol extracts. Fisetin and quercetin were higher in WGK (1.176 mg/100 g) and (10.967 mg/100 g) dry extract weight respectively. Antibacterial activity against food spoilage bacteria was dose-dependent and found to be highest for all the extracts from different solvents and altitudes at higher concentrations (80 mg/ml). Similarly, methanol and ethanol guava extracts from all locations showed antifungal activity against Geotrichum candidum RIBB-SCM43 and Geotrichum candidum RIBB-SCM44.

On the other hand, at present, diabetes and obesity are the most serious public health issues and are increasing subsequently at alarming rate. In view of this, the present in vitro context was aimed to investigate the antibacterial activities of Momordica charantia (M. charantia) fruits extracts against poultry associated Bacillus spp. and to assess further its phytoconstituents, alpha-(alpha)-glucosidase activities, and anti-obesity properties. The anti-pathogenic attributes of M. charantia fruit extracts were carried out using disc diffusion assay and results showed the pronounced antibacterial trait of ethanolic extract with maximum zone of inhibition of 28.3 +/- 1.2 mm against Bacillus licheniformis. The qualitative phytochemical analyses of fruit extracts illustrated the presence of diverse phytoconstituents. The alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay for the extracts was performed according to the a-glucosidase activity kit. The results depicted the lowest alpha-glucosidase activity (57.13 +/- 2.3 to 18.14 +/- 1.3 U/L) in the presence of ethanolic extract at varied concentrations. The anti-obesity potentialities of fruit extracts were demonstrated in terms of porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL type II) activity using p-nitro-phenyl butyrate (p-NPB) as a substrate. The ethanolic extract of M. charantia fruits was observed to exhibit maximum inhibition of pancreatic lipase ranging from 20.12 +/- 2.3 to 68.34 +/- 1.3% in a dose dependent manner with an IC50 value of 607.6 +/- 1.3 mu g/mL. FTIR and GC-MS results indicated the presence of distinct compounds in the ethanol extract and major bioactive constituents were found to be Dimethyl sulfone (35.24%), 9-octadecanamide (20.52%), Pentadecanoic acid (6.64%), Lanost-9 (11)-en-18-oic acid, 23-(acetylxyl)-3-(4-bromobenzoyl) oxyl-20-hydroxyl-gamma-lactone (2.6%), and 2,2-sulfonyldiethanol (2.46%).

(Turmeric),"Aims: Rhizome of turmeric is known to possess therapeutic activities and has been used in medical practice as an antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective, anti-diarrheal, and anti-asthma agent. This study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of Curcuma longa. Methodology and results: Rhizomes of Curcuma longa (Turmeric) purchased from markets in Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria, were analysed for anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, as well as phytochemical constituents. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of the C. longa methanol extract (CLME) were evaluated by albumin denaturation, proteinase inhibitory activity, membrane stabilization, and anti-lipoxygenase activity, at different concentrations using Aspirin, Diclofenac sodium and Indomethacin as standard drugs. The in vitro antimicrobial activities of CLME were carried out on five pathogenic microbes namely Escherichia coli ATCC 29929, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29293, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4252 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using both agar well diffusion and broth dilution techniques. A S. typhimurium infected rat model was used for in vivo antimicrobial studies. Phytochemical analyses showed that C. longa rhizomes contain high concentrations of alkaloids, flavonoid and saponins, with moderate levels of phenols, tannin and ferric reducing antioxidant power. CLME was found to be rich in alkaloids, tannins, phenols, steroids, saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids and reducing sugars. CLME showed potent anti-inflammatory activities, and the results compared favourably with the standard anti-inflammatory drugs used. C. longa methanol extract significantly inhibited albumin denaturation and proteinase activity, stabilized membrane of red blood cell from haemolysis in heat and hypotonic conditions, as well inhibited lipoxygenase activity; all of which are associated with inflammatory processes. CLME was found to possess high in vitro antimicrobial activities against the five microorganisms tested. Rats orally infected with S. typhimurium, demonstrated bacteraemia five days post infection, with a total clearance of bacteraemia within 3-5 days following oral administration of CLME. The infected rats treated with CLME equally showed significant improvement in some haematological indices compared to infected rats that were not treated with CLME. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The results also showed that methanol extract of C. longa rhizome effectively cured with S. typhimurium infected rats.

Herein, we studied chemical profile and biological activities of Phlomis fruticosa L. after plant material storage for 20 years. Chemical analyzes were performed by UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap/MS, and revealed presence of 44 compounds: including 13 phenolic acids, 9 phenylethanoids, 20 flavonoids and 2 phenolic related compounds (a phenolic acid derivative and an aliphatic alcohol). The extract showed antimicrobial activity, being the most potent against Aspergillus fumigatus with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.31 mg/mL. Also, the extract was able to inhibit biofilm formed by Candida species and to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus. Obtained results revealed that the extract has potential to interfere with the cell membrane permeability of Candida albicans and to suppress production of virulence factor staphyloxanthin in S. aureus. Furthermore, the extract inhibited the activity of a-amylase which is one of the therapeutic targets for diabetes type II. Also, the antiproliferative effect of the extract was demonstrated on human cancer cell lines, while the extract did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect on primary human cells.

Bilberry seed oil (BSO) was dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase of anthocyanins (AC) and whey protein isolate. The microstructure was evaluated using light microscopy and the effect of anthocyanins on lipid oxidation and microbial growth was investigated. The results showed that it was possible to generate a stable emulsion structure that resisted phase separation during 25 weeks of storage. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of the fatty acids in the BSO during storage showed that AC had a protective effect against lipid oxidation.

Hydroethanolic extracts were obtained using four extraction techniques: one conventional (CE) and three alternative methods; ultrasound (UAE), microwave (MAE) and high-pressure (HPE) extractions. Spectrophotometric analysis was conducted to determine their chemical content, including the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). Furthermore, their antioxidative and antimicrobial properties were evaluated. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) analysis identified and quantified 17 phenolic compounds, with chlorogenic acid being the predominant compound, with the lowest level (37.36 +/- 0.06 mg/g) for the bog bilberry leaf extract obtained by CE and the highest levels (e.g., HPE = 44.47 +/- 0.08 mg/g) for the bog bilberry leaf extracts obtained by the alternative methods. Extracts obtained by HPE, UAE and MAE presented TPC values (135.75 +/- 2.86 mg GAE/g; 130.52 +/- 1.99 mg GAE/g; 119.23 +/- 1.79 mg GAE/g) higher than those obtained by the CE method (113.07 +/- 0.98 mg GAE/g). Regarding the TFC values, similar to TPC, the highest levels were registered in the extracts obtained by alternative methods (HPE = 43.16 +/- 0.12 mg QE/g; MAE = 39.79 +/- 0.41 mg QE/g and UAE = 33.89 +/- 0.35 mg QE/g), while the CE extract registered the lowest level, 31.47 +/- 0.28 mg QE/g. In the case of DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) antioxidant activity, the extracts from HPE, UAE and MAE exhibited the strongest radical scavenging capacities of 71.14%, 63.13% and 60.84%, respectively, whereas the CE extract registered only 55.37%. According to Microbiology Reader LogPhase 600 (BioTek), a common MIC value of 8.88 mg/mL was registered for all types of extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) and Salmonella enterica (Gram-negative bacteria). Moreover, the alternative extraction methods (UAE, HPE) effectively inhibited the growth of Candida parapsilosis, in comparison to the lack of inhibition from the CE method.

However, the pomace and juice deriving from the pressing may represent innovative raw materials, and in the present study, the aim was to compare phenolic composition and biological activities of hydroalcoholic extracts obtained from grape pomace and juice of the cultivars Sagrantino, Tintilia, Vernaccia and Falanghina. While the Falanghina hydroalcoholic extract showed the highest total phenol level and antiradical potential, in Sagrantino pomace and Vernaccia juice, the catechin concentration was up to 20-fold higher compared to the other extracts. They also displayed the highest antimycotic effects, especially against Trichophyton rubrum and Arthroderma crocatum. However, their mycostatic effects could be only partially related to the catechin content. Indeed, the putative binding of catechin towards lanosterol-14-alpha-demethylase, deeply involved in fungal metabolism, would occur at a concentration ten-fold higher compared to the catechin level corresponding to the extracts' MIC; thus suggesting multiple antimycotic mechanisms.

Wall. ex Nees, and to clarify action mode of andrographolide. Methods: The chemical composition was extracted by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively. Andrographolide and its derivatives were evaluated by HPLC. Moreover, the metabolic profiling was analyzed by GC-MS. Inhibitory effect of crude extracts was tested against Staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method. Mode of action was tested against mutant yeast by spotting assay. Andrographolide were tested for their mode of action against eukaryotes. Results: Among different solvents, dichloromethane gave the highest yield of crude (3.58% DW), with the highest andrographolide content (8.3 mg/g DW). The effect of plant hormone (10 mg/L GA(3) or PBZ) on phytochemical variations and bioactivity of Andrographis paniculata was demonstrated. It was found that PBZ promoted sesquiterpene compounds about 3.5 times over than GA(3) treatment. But inhibitory effect of extracts against Staphylococcus aureus was highest in GA(3) treated plants; andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide contents were significantly higher than those of water or PBZ. It was found that there were 11 strains involving in ergosterol biosynthesis, V-ATPase activity and homeostasis, and superoxide detoxification process. In this regard, andrographolide might cause the damage on the lipid bilayer of yeast cell and plasma membrane by interfering ergosterol biosynthesis. Conclusions: It is found that GA(3) promotes andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide content while PBZ promotes sesquiterpene content. Andrographolide might cause the damage on the lipid bilayer of yeast cell and plasma membrane by interfering ergosterol biosynthesis.

However, these synthetic drugs often have harmful side effects. Natural products, particularly plants, offer safer alternatives with bioactive compounds that can be used for synthesizing new drugs and developing natural remedies.Methods Utilizing an ultrasonic-assisted extraction technique, two distinct preparations of Eminium spiculatum (E. spiculatum) extract were produced. These extracts were obtained using ethanol solutions at concentrations of 100% and 50%, respectively. The biological activities of E. spiculatum extracts were evaluated using chemical assay methods. Specifically, the study assessed the antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant properties of these extracts through standardized chemical techniques. The antimicrobial impact was examined against E.coli, Streptococcus species, as well as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using the well diffusion method. Furthermore, anticancer tests demonstrated activity against HT29 (colon cancer cells) and MCF7 (breast cancer cells).Results The findings revealed complete cell death with both 100% as well as 50% ethanol extracts compared to the control. The extracts exhibited notable antioxidant scavenging capacity against the stable radical DPPH, with values of 298.7 +/- 3.3 and 190.8 +/- 2.2 mu mol Trolox/g for 50% and 100% ethanolic extracts, respectively. These outcomes can be attributed to the extracts' abundant phenolic content (107.3 +/- 3.1 and 99.7 +/- 2.0 mg GAE/g for 50% and 100% ethanolic extracts, respectively) and flavonoid content (67.9 +/- 2.9 and 45.6 +/- 2.8 mg catechin/g for 50% and 100% ethanolic extracts, respectively).Conclusion The assessment of E. spiculatum plant extracts revealed significant antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities.

Antimicrobial efficacy was also determined. Chicken patties enriched with extracts to monitor thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile nitrogen (TVN), water holding capacity (WHC), pH, and cooking properties during 12 days of 4 degrees C storage, and half-life was determined.ResultsThe major bioactive compounds in seed and peel extracts were tannic (18.95 and 41.25 mg/kg) and gallic acid (16.49 and 36.59 mg/kg). Phenolics and flavonoids reached 66.71 and 9.72 mg/mL in seeds and 187.60 and 25.53 mg/mL in peels. Extracts showed antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with considerable inhibition zones for seed (10, 9, 8 mu m/mL) and peel (12, 10, and 10 mu m/mL). Formulating chicken patties with 1%(w/w) extracts reduced lipid oxidation (TBA), TVN, and cooking loss by 48.2, 49.2, and 6.6% but increased WHC by 14.9% at the end of storage.ConclusionThe study enlightened the feasibility of using peels and seeds of pomegranate as a natural and economical alternative to chemical preservatives to prolong the shelf-life of meat products. The proposed valorization methodology converted food waste to natural preservatives and reduced food waste by extending patties' shelf-life. Implementing such a waste valorization and waste reduction approach could significantly enhance resource efficiency to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs) and net zero.RecommendationFuture research might consider using emerging technologies (e.g., ultrasound and electric field) to increase extraction efficiency and nanotechnology to enhance the stability of seed and peel extracts.

Macleaya cordata, a traditional medicinal plant, has been widely used in livestock animals, plants, and humans. Alkaloids are the primary bioactive compounds of Macleaya cordata and exhibit antibacterial, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant activities. Nevertheless, the antibacterial compounds and mode of action of Macleaya cordata remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antibacterial activity and mode of action of alkaloids from Macleaya cordata. Sanguinarine, 6-ethoxysanguinarine (6-ES), 6-methoxydihydrosanguinarine (6-MS), chelerythrine (CH), and dihydrochelerythrine (DICH) exhibited good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. 6-ES rapidly killed MRSA, possibly by interfering with membrane and metabolic functions including ROS production by targeting the membrane and FtsZ in S. aureus. Additionally, 6-ES directly suppressed the hemolytic activity of alpha-hemolysin, alleviated inflammatory responses, and eliminated intracellular MRSA, as well as displayed low development of drug resistance, in vitro. Finally, a 6-ES-loaded thermosensitive hydrogel promoted wound healing in mice infected with MRSA.

They exhibited the typical Mediterranean chemical profile, rich in diterpene compounds (18-92% of TIC, GC-MS): 32 individual diterpenes were identified; 22 of them were present in each specimen. The other abundant compound group was that of sugars and sugar derivatives. In some samples, however, another compound group was observed (0-12% of TIC, GC-MS); the corresponding mass spectra were consistent with mono- and sesquiterpenyl esters of substituted benzoic acids. Two new propolis constituents of this group, daucane diterpene esters of hydroxybenzoic acids, were isolated. Their origin is suggested to be Ferula communis, as they are taxonomic markers for this species. All propolis samples were active against Staphylococcus aureus but only those with high concentrations of terpenyl esters showed antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The present results confirm that Mediterranean propolis is a valuable natural product with potential to improve human health. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It was also used as sedative and anaesthetic agent. In this work the phytochemical investigation using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS and GC-MS techniques was done for chemical characterization of methanol extracts of underground and aerial plant parts. In the course of our studies on medicinal plants, we evaluated the extracts of P. caeruleum for their biological activities as antimicrobial, antimalarial, anti-leishmanial and antitrypanosomal agents and we investigated their cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells - HEK293 and Vero cell lines, both originating from kidney and also against pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, FaDu cell line. LC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis confirmed the presence of triterpene saponins - oleanane derivatives (polemoniumsaponins, glycosides of theasapogenol derivatives and beta-amyrin among others), as well as flavonoid glycosides with most predominant acacetin derivatives. Saponins were more abundant and varied in the extract from underground parts of the plant, while flavonoids dominated in the extract from aerial parts. GC-MS performed after silanization enabled the identification of carbohydrates, fatty acid esters, amino acids and carboxylic acids. In the present study, the antibacterial activity of crude extract of the aerial parts of P. caeruleum against Escherichia coli with an IC50 of 137.0 mu g/mL and antitrypanosomal activity of crude extract of the underground parts of P. caeruleum with an IC50 of 16.03 mu g/mL were reported.

While apricots are widely studied for their alimentary uses (e.g., fresh and dried fruits, and oil production), the leaves are valued in traditional medicine due to their high concentration of bioactive compounds. These compounds make apricot leaves valuable for both medicinal and chemical applications. The healing properties of apricot leaves are primarily attributed to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, which are linked to chemical constituents such as flavonoids and phenolic compounds. However, the increasing use of agrochemicals may influence the content of these bioactive compounds and negatively affect their properties. Despite this concern, studies addressing these issues remain scarce in literature. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of pesticides (Topaz and Confidor) on flavonoid and total phenolic content in apricot leaves through field surveys and biochemical analyses and to identify correlations between the phenolic content in the extracts and the antimicrobial activities of the examined samples. Methods: The experiments were conducted in the Kotayk region of the Republic of Armenia (RA). The research material was the apricot leaves collected from the trees treated twice with the fungicide Topaz and the insecticide Confidor, after allowing for complete detoxification in the leaves. Trees sprayed with water served as a control group. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay (Method of Wells). Polyphenolic compounds were quantified using methods described by Yermakov. Results: According to the results obtained, the inhibitory activity of the apricot leaf extracts against the tested microorganisms (Gram positive (Staphylococcus citreus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bac. megatherium, B. subtilis), Gram negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphymurium) and fungus ( Candida guillermondii) is correlated with the concentration of total phenolic compounds, tannins and flavonoids in the leaves by polynomial 3 order equations. Conclusions: Our data indicates a certain impact of pesticides on the content of the total PC, tannins and flavonoids in apricot leaves, which explains the different antimicrobial activity on the same microorganisms of the tested extracts coming from.",FUNCTIONAL FOODS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE,FUNCTIONAL FOOD CENTER INC,Apricot leaves; phenolic compounds; antibacterial and antifungal activities; pesticides,,"[Grigoryan, Anna M.] Russian Armenian Univ RAU, Yerevan, Armenia; [Mirzoyan, Varsik S.] Sci Ctr Risks Assessment & Anal Food Safety Area, Masisi St,107-2 Bldg, Yerevan 0071, Armenia; [Hanisyan, Ruzanna M.; Karapetyan, Tamara D.] Yerevan State Med Univ, Yerevan, Armenia; [Sahakyan, Naira Zh.] Yerevan State Univ, Yerevan, Armenia",Armeniaca vulgaris,,Rosaceae,,"tannins, phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids, noise","tannins, phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids, noise","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Armeniaca vulgaris,Rosaceae,Armeniaca,Armenia

Among the existing cultivars, Kweli is one of the most productive and widely cultivated. In this study, the nutritional value and chemical composition of Kweli red raspberry were characterized by the official method of food analysis and chromatographic techniques, and its antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were tested against biological/biochemical oxidizable substrates and foodborne bacteria and fungi strains, respectively. Carbohydrates (including fructose and glucose, 14.3 and 12.6 g/100 g dw, respectively), proteins (6.8 g/100 g dw), and ashes (3.90 g/100 g dw) were major constituents. The fat content was quite low and constituted mainly by unsaturated fatty acids (58.3%), with a predominance of oleic acid. Fresh red raspberry also contained high levels of citric (2.7 g/100 g) and ascorbic (17 mg/100 g) acids. The anthocyanins (4.51 mg/g extract) cyanidin-O-hexoside and mostly cyanidin-O-sophoroside were identified in the red raspberry hydroethanolic extract, which was able to inhibit thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation (EC50 of 122 mu g/mL), oxidative hemolysis (IC50 of 298 mu g/mL), and beta-carotene bleaching (EC50 of 18.7 mu g/mL). In turn, the extract was more effective than the food additive E224 against Bacillus cereus.

Therefore, in the undertaken study, its wound healing attributes are determined. Aim of the study: The current study provided evidence of the traditional use of A. nilotica species and conferred A. nilotica bark extract as a potent candidate for wound healing agents. Materials & methods: A. nilotica leaves extract (ANL-E); A. nilotica bark extract (ANB-E), and A. nilotica stem extract (ANS-E) were prepared using methanol-chloroform (1:1). Phytochemical analysis was performed using gallic acid equivalent (GAE) total phenolic content (TPC), quercetin equivalent (QE) total flavonoid content (TFC) assays and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In vitro antioxidant potential (free radical scavenging activity (FRSA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay), antibacterial activity (broth microdilution method) and hemolytic analysis was carried out. Wound healing proficiency of ANB-E was determined by wound excision model followed by estimating hydroxyproline content and endogenous antioxidant markers. Results: Maximum phenolic and flavonoid content were depicted by ANB-E i.e., 50.9 +/- 0.34 mu g gallic acid equivalent/mg extract and 28.7 +/- 0.13 mu g quercetin equivalent/mg extract, respectively.

An efficient and fast technique has been achieved for the screening of the major phenolics in methanolic crude extract (MCE) and two soluble fractions; ethyl acetate (EAF) and water (WF) fractions, from the shoot of A. campestris by LC-MS methods using time-of-flight. A total of 39 molecules were detected and tentatively identified, including coumarins, flavones, flavonols, phenolic acids and sesquiterpenes. Twenty-four of them were identified for the first time in this species. The major phenolic compounds are principally luteolin-7-O-rutinoside in MCE, rhamnetin and isorhamnetin in EAF, hydroxycoumarin and kaempferol rutinoside in WF and three di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers in all extracts. Moreover, total phenolic, flavonoid and tanin contents were established and three in vitro tests were assessed to assess the antioxidant activity. Agar disk diffusion technique was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity against 14 pathogen strains. Concerning the results of antioxidant assays, MCE, and EAF at lesser extends, displayed the highest antioxidant capacity (IC50 values are equal to 6 and 1011 mu g/ml for DPPH test, respectively). Besides, EAF was more potent and showed an appreciable antimicrobial activity mainly against Bacillus thuringiensis (inhibition zone (IZ) = 18 mm) and Vi bra vulnificus (IZ= 16 mm), while, MCE more active against Listeria monocytogenes (IZ= 13.5 mm). The relevant antioxidant and antibacterial activities of MCE and EAF corroborated with their chemical compositions dominated by flavonoids. This finding suggests that A. campestris is a promising plant for industry and can be used as additive and conservative to preserve food spoilage. (C) 201-4 Elsevier-B.V.

In 2019, the world's fig fruit production was estimated at 1153 tons. However, fig leaves are not utilized, resulting in copious quantities of bio-waste. To identify promising fig tree varieties, hydroethanolic extracts were prepared from the leaves of five fig tree varieties (Pasteliere-PA, Longue d'Aout-LA, Dauphinie-DA, Boujassote Noire-BN, and Marseille-MA). The variety with the highest concentration of organic acids was BN (146.5 mg/g dw), while glucose, fructose, and sucrose were the predominant sugars across all varieties. All extracts present alpha-tocopherol as the prevalent tocopherol isoform (above 78%), while PUFA fatty acids were predominant, ranging from 53% to 71% of total fatty acids. BN showed moderate antioxidant activity (EC50 0.23 +/- 0.01 mg/mL), while the DA variety presented promising cytotoxicity against the tumor AGS and MCF-7 cell line (GI(50) 158 +/- 13 and 223 +/- 21 mu g/mL) and especially in the inhibition of Nitric Oxide Production evaluation (IC50 20 +/- 5 mu g/mL). The DA activities are probably related to high concentrations of flavonoids, specifically the predominant apigenin-C-hexoside-C-pentoside and quercetin-O-deoxyhexosyl-hexoside.

Allium tenuissimum flower essential oil was extracted from fresh Allium tenuissimum flower by hydro-distillation method. Its antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes were determined by diameters of the inhibition zone. Escherichia coli O157:H7 treated with the essential oil had the largest diameter of the inhibition zone (15.2 mm) among the three strains. Allyl methyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were two main compounds of the essential oil, as analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial characteristics of these two compounds against Escherichia coli O157:H7 were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations, morphologies, cytomembrane destructions, biomacromolecule contents, and metabolic enzyme activities. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of allyl methyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were both 0.7 mg/mL, and minimum bactericidal concentrations of these two compounds were both 1.4 mg/mL. The images of atomic force microscopy exhibited that the surface structures and cytomembranes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 cells were rigorously damaged by 1.4 mg/mL of allyl methyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, leading to the change of & beta;-galactosidases and the leakage of cellular nucleic acids from the bacterial cells. Moreover, the intensities of deoxyribonucleic acid and protein bands of the bacterial cells were significantly decreased after treated with these two compounds at 1.4 mg/mL. Adenosine triphosphatase activities (3.75 and 1.97 U/mg prot) of the bacterial cells treated with allyl methyl disulfide (1.4 mg/mL) and dimethyl trisulfide (1.4 mg/mL) were distinctly lower than the activity of the control (6.05 U/mg prot). Allyl methyl disulfide (1.4 mg/mL) and dimethyl trisulfide (1.4 mg/mL) inactivated 84.20 % and 90.76 % respiratory-chain dehydrogenase of the bacterial cells, respectively.

(M. calabura). Methods: Dried leaves and stems of M. calabura were extracted with 95% ethanol. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were examined using the disc diffusion assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each extract showing antimicrobial activity was determined. The dried extracts were subjected to phytochemical screening to determine the presence of bioactive components. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and the aluminum chloride method, respectively. Results: Varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were exhibited by the leaf and stem extracts against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans (C. albicans), with minimal activity against Escherichia coli. Based on the MIC, the extracts showed the highest activity against C. albicans, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of sterols, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, glycosides and tannins in the leaf extract; however, no triterpenes were detected. In the stem extract, triterpenes were detected along with relative amounts of flavonoids, saponins, glycosides and tannins. Alkaloids and sterols were absent in the stem extract.

Previous literature has pointed out importance of this plant from medicinal point of view. This plant has shown its potential against bacteria, fungus, spleen enlargement, urinary infections, cancer and fever. The present work was designed to examine different therapeutic effects of its extracts. Aqueous macerated and decocted extracts of leaf, fresh fruit, dry fruit, fresh seed, dry seed, and bark were prepared for in-vitro analytical purposes. Phytochemical screening was done by qualitative and quantitative methods. Antiradical efficacy was assessed by DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2, 2-azinobis-(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and metal chelation assays. Glycation inhibitory potential was examined by spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods. Disc diffusion method was adopted to analyze antimicrobial activity. Phytochemical screening confirmed significant presence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, phenols and carbohydrates. Total phenolic contents (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) were shown as gallic acid and rutin equivalents respectively. Maximum presence of TPC was found in decocted dry seed extract (0.603 +/- 0.001mg/g) and maximum TFC were estimated in decocted leaf extract (0.09 +/- 0.012 mg/g). Decocted and macerated fresh fruit extracts showed best ability to reduce DPPH (93.1 +/- 0.6 % and 91.3 +/- 0.2 % respectively). Macerated fresh seed extract and decocted bark extract exhibited maximum antiradical potential (85.7 +/- 1.2 % and 84.3 +/- 0.8 % respectively) in ABTS assay. In metal chelation assay maximum radical Inhibition potential was observed for macerated bark extract (91.4 +/- 0.6 %) and decocted fresh seed extract (91.6 +/- 1.1 %). Against all studied microbial strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) highest inhibition zones were given by bark extract. Bark and dry seed extracts showed 86% and 88% glycation inhibition potential in spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric analysis respectively.

Despite a previous study on the essential oils (EO) of K. champasakensis leaves, no other studies have reported the chemical components and biological activities of K. champasakensis. Therefore, this study aims to identify the chemical constituents of the EO from the rhizomes of K. champasakensis and evaluate their antimicrobial activity, which has been re-confirmed through molecular docking studies. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis revealed sixty-one constituents (95.4%) present in the EO of K. champasakensis rhizomes. Among them, camphene (40.7%), alpha-pinene (10.2%), and beta-pinene (7.6%) were identified as the main compounds in the EO. Bioassays indicated its antimicrobial activity in the order of inhibitory effectiveness: Staphylococcus aureus > Enterococcus faecalis approximate to Candida albicans > Bacillus cereus approximate to Escherichia coli > Salmonella enterica > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The molecular docking study of ligand-protein interactions involving the major constituents of EO was conducted against target proteins related to Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli main activities. The results revealed that alpha-pinene exhibited strong binding affinity against E. coli, beta-pinene demonstrated more effective inhibition against E. faecalis and B. cereus, and camphene primarily exhibited activity against C. albicans and S. aureus. Furthermore, the analysis of interactions between the main compounds and the selected proteins was elucidated in the current study.

The present study was carried out to assess the antimicrobial activity and to evaluate the antispasmodic potential of B. chrysogonum tuber extract. Materials and Methods: Extracts were also evaluated for antimicrobial potential against Bacillus subtills, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined by using the micro dilution method. To evaluate the antispasmodic activity of B. chrysogonum extract on contractions induced by the spasmogens acetylcholine, BaCl2 and KCl, contractions of rat duodenum were recorded using an isolated tissue bath chamber with an isotonic transducer and oscillographic device. Results were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post test. Results: Preliminary phytochemical screening of the tuber extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins and carbohydrates, including monosaccharides. No antimicrobial activity was observed against gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria; however, ethanolic B. chrysogonum tuber extract attenuated the basal contractile activity of rat duodenum smooth muscle and decreased contractions induced by acetylcholine, KCl and BaCl2, suggesting an antimuscarinic effect and/or interference of calcium influx. Alkaloids and saponins present in the extract may account for this antispasmodic effect, suggesting multiple mechanisms that can be explored in future studies.

This study aimed to assess the phytochemical and biological activities of four Astragalus species growing wild in Jerusalem. Methods: Phytochemical screening, estimation of total phenols, flavonoids and tannin contents, as well as antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were investigated for Astragalus aleppicus, Astragalus angustifolius, Astragalus annularis, and Astragalus boeticus. Phytochemical screening, evaluation of total phenols, flavonoids, tannins contents as well as antioxidant properties were investigated by using standard phytochemical methods. Detection of antimicrobial activities for both the aqueous and the methanolic extracts were performed using the broth micro-dilution method. The antimicrobial activities were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa American Type Culture Collection reference strains, as well as against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans clinical isolates. Results: A mixture of phytochemical compounds was found in the extracts of all tested Astragalus species. A. boeticus was found to contain high levels of total phenols, flavonoids and tannins with remarkable potential of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The current study provides initial data that justify the use and importance of Astragalus species in Palestinian folkloric medicine. Conclusion: Our results showed that A. boeticus was superior to the other 3 species in all the conducted tests. In fact, it had the highest polyphenolic content. In addition, its aqueous extract showed the highest antibacterial activity, while the methanolic extract showed the highest antifungal and antioxidant activities.

Schott is a deciduous perennial herb, which has been used traditionally for treatment of ringworm infections and others skin diseases in the north of China. Aim of the study: To characterize the chemical composition, evaluate the antifungal activity and explore possible mechanisms about action of ethanol extracts of D. fragrans. Materials and methods: The chemical components in the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC) of the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A2 method against 62 isolates of dermatophytes. The kinetics of fungal kill, synergy testing by checkerboard dilution and quantitation of sterol by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) on Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes were also investigated. Results: Fourteen derivatives of phloroglucinol were identified in the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans. The MIC of the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans ranged from 0.059 to 3.780 mg/mL while MFC ranged from 0.118 to 3.780 mg/mL. The ethanol extracts of D. fragrans exerted fungicidal activity after 12 h of incubation against Trichophyton rubrum while it required 36 h of incubation against Trichophyton mentagrophytes at concentrations of 8 x MIC. In synergy testing, the interaction between miconazole (MCZ) and terbinafine (TBF) with the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans proved to be indifferent by testing fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values. Sterol in samples of fungal cells treated with the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans was significantly reduced. Conclusions: The ethanol extracts of D. fragrans had antifungal and fungicidal activity against dermatophytes and was likely a strain-dependent fungicidal agent. Interaction between drugs was indifferent on tested isolates. The inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis was one of the antifungal mechanisms of the ethanol extracts of D. fragrans.

Aspergillus versicolor and A. ochraceus were the most sensitive microorganisms to the isolated compounds whereas Candida albicans was the most resistant fungus. Compounds 4, 5, and 6 did not exhibit much variation in their antibacterial activities except against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The most sensitive bacterium to isolated compounds was Bacillus cereus whereas the most resistant one was Enterobacter cloacae. However, compounds 4, 6 and 7 exhibited the highest antiproliferative activities against most cancer cells. The study reveal that F. drupacea stem barks contain several compounds that have antimicrobial activities against diverse human pathogenic, food and agricultural microbes as well as anticancer activities against human cancer cells of HeLa, MCF-7, Jurkat, HT-29 and T24.

Investigation of the phenolic composition showed that vanillic acid and coumarin were the major compounds in the two organs, with higher percentages in the cultivated organs than in the spontaneous organs. Furthermore, R. chalepensis extracts showed marked antibacterial properties against human pathogen strains, and the activity was organ- and origin-dependent. Spontaneous stems had the strongest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Results showed extracts with 1.2 g of mesocarp with 30 mL ethanol 94% (1:25 ratio w/v), for 20 min, at 20 degrees C, yields high values of Total Phenolic Contents (TPC: 5124.86 +/- 350.13 mg GAE/ 100 g), flavonoids (TFC: 477.45 +/- 23.07 mg QE/100 g), antioxidant capacity (FRAP: 4037.56 +/- 187.26 mu mol TEAC/100 g, DPPH center dot remaining from 10 to 38% after stabilization). Moreover, the DPPH center dot assay also suggests that each solid-liquid ratio recovers antioxidant compounds able to react with DPPH by differential Kinect, which can conveniently favor usability and enhance oxidative stability in food applications. For example, the extract obtained by the 1:4 ratio reacted very fast with DPPH center dot (less than 1 min), while on the 1:25 ratio, the stabilization of DPPH center dot is slower, taking more than 120 min.

In this context, natural products have been widely used as a strategy to treat diseases caused by bacteria. Infections by Helicobacter pylori have attracted attention because they are directly related to severe gastric medical conditions. Casearia sylvestris Swartz, popularly known as guacatonga, is largely employed to treat gastric disorders in Brazilian folk medicine. This plant species has aroused much interest mainly because it displays anti-inflammatory activity and can act as an antiulcer agent. Aim of the study: To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-H. pylori action of C. sylvestris leaf derivatives incorporated or not in a nanostructured drug delivery system. Materials and methods: The essential oil (obtained by hydrodistillation) and ethanolic extract (obtained by maceration) were obtained from C. sylvestris leaves. The ethanolic extract was submitted to fractionation through solid phase extraction and column chromatography, to yield the ethanolic fractions. Hydrolyzed casearin J was achieved by submitting isolated casearin J to acid hydrolysis. The derivatives were chemically characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS) analyses. A nanostructured lipid system was used as drug delivery system. To assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of C. sylvestris leaf essential oil, ethanolic extract, and derivatives, microdilution, biofilm, and time-kill assays were performed against H. pylori ATCC 43504. Finally, the in vivo action was investigated by employing male Wistar rats experimentally infected with H. pylori. Results: Many C. sylvestris leaf derivatives presented significant in vitro activity against H. pylori. Among the derivatives, fraction 2 (F2) was the most effective. In vivo tests showed that both the ethanolic extract and F2 decreased the ulcerative lesion size, but only the ethanolic extract eradicated H. pylori from the gastric lesions. Incorporation of plant derivatives in nanostructured lipid system blunted the in vitro action, as demonstrated by the microdilution assay. However, this incorporation improved the ethanolic extract activity against biofilms. Conclusion: C. sylvestris leaf derivatives are effective against H. pylori both in vitro and in vivo. According to phytochemical analyses, these derivatives are rich in terpenoids, which could be related to the anti-H. pylori action. Synergism could also underlie C. sylvestris efficacy judging from the fact that the sub-fractions and isolated compounds had lower activity than the extract. Incorporation in a nanostructured lipid system did not improve the activity of the compounds in our in vivo protocol.",JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,Helicobacter pylori; Casearia sylvestris; Diterpenes; Microdilution; Antibacterial activity,CLERODANE DITERPENES; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ESSENTIAL OIL; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; ANTIULCER ACTIVITY; ETHANOLIC EXTRACT; PLANT-EXTRACTS; SNAKE-VENOM; LEAVES; INFECTION,"[Sposito, Larissa; Vieira, Julia Hunger; dos Santos Ramos, Matheus Aparecido; Bauab, Tais Maria] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Rod Araraquara Jau Km 01, BR-14800903 Araraquara, SP, Brazil; [Oda, Fernando Bombarda; Carvalho, Flavio Alexandre; de Castro, Rogerio Cardoso; Santos, Andre Gonzaga] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Nat Act Principles & Toxicol, Araraquara, SP, Brazil; [Crevelin, Eduardo Jose; Miller Crotti, Antonio Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Philosophy Sci & Letters, Dept Chem, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [da Silva, Patricia Bento; Chorilli, Marlus] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drugs & Med, Araraquara, SP, Brazil",Casearia sylvestris,,Salicaceae,,"noise, terpenoids","noise, terpenoids",Helicobacter pylori,negative,,Casearia sylvestris,Salicaceae,Casearia,Brazil

Purpose: The study was performed to evaluate the biological and chemical profile of two extracts (methanol (T-Me; F-Me) and water (T-W; F-W)) from two parts (twigs and fruits) of Cotoneaster integerrimus. Materials and methods: Antioxidant (free radical scavenging (DPPH), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating), enzyme inhibitory (cholinesterase, tyrosinase, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase), antimicrobial (standard microorganisms and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (MRSA)) and mutagenic/antimutagenic effects (by Ames assay) were tested for biological profile. For chemical profile, total and individual phenolic components were detected for each extract. Results: Generally, T-Me reflected the strongest biological effects with the highest level of phenolics (115. 15 mgGAEs/g extract). Also, twig extracts had more potent biological effects as compared to flower extracts. Eight-teen phenolics were identified in the extracts. (-)- epicatechin was the major constituent in all extracts and is mainly responsible for biological activities observed. Its amount present in F-W and T-W were 9.27 and 32.89 mg/g extract, respectively. Also, molecular docking was used to understand enzyme-epicatechin interactions.

Crude extracts of leaves, roots, stems, and seeds, prepared from solvents of varying polarities, were subjected to phytochemical, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antidiabetic, and cytotoxicity assays. Maximum extraction yield (20.0% w/w) was observed in the case of an acetone:methanol (AC:M) root extract. Distilled water:methanol (W:M) leaves extract showed maximum phenolic contents. Maximum flavonoid content and free radical scavenging potential were found in methanolic (M) seed extract. HPLC-DAD quantification displayed the manifestation of substantial quantities of quercetin, rutin, gallic acid, quercetin, catechin, and kaempferol in various extracts. The highest ascorbic acid equivalent total antioxidant capacity and reducing power potential was found in distilled water roots and W:M leaf extracts, respectively. Chloroform (C) seeds extract produced a maximum zone of inhibition against Salmonella typhimurium. Promising protein kinase inhibition and antifungal activity against Mucor sp. were demonstrated by C leaf extract.

In this study, we examine the wound-healing activity of Dittrichia viscosa lipidic extract in vivo, assess its antimicrobial effect, and explore the specific compounds that contribute to these effects. To assess the effectiveness of wound healing, a burn-induced wound model was employed in Wistar rats, and the levels of hydroxyproline as well as histopathological changes in the skin tissues were evaluated. Furthermore, the antimicrobial potential against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Malassezia furfur was investigated using the agar disc diffusion method. Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques were employed to analyze the composition of fatty acids, phytosterols, and tocopherols. Topical application of Dittrichia viscosa lipidic fraction ointment exhibited significant improvements in wound contraction, achieving an impressive rate of 82% within 21 days. Additionally, the lipidic extract of Dittrichia viscosa displayed notable efficacy against various microbial strains, including Candida albicans (25.07 +/- 0.2), Candida glabrata (24 +/- 0.6), and Malassezia furfur (22 +/- 0.7).

Persea duthiei is a typical medicinal plant used to treat a variety of ailments such as asthma, edema, and bronchitis. Ethyl acetate, n-hexane, n-butanol, and compounds that are soluble in water were used to examine the antibacterial as well as antifungal capacities of the plant. The antibacterial activity of the soluble parts of ethyl acetate and n-hexane against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, and Bacillus subtilis was high, even though there was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Likewise, the n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were found to have substantial efficacy against several fungal strains such as Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigates, Fusarium solani, and Aspergillus niger, but not against Candida glabrata. Among the studied fractions, the ethyl acetate soluble fraction had potent antibacterial activity against all of the tested species. This fraction was submitted to phytochemical analysis utilizing various chromatographic methods for the extraction of various pure components. As a consequence, four compounds were isolated, and their structures were elucidated using various spectroscopic methods such as IR, EIMS, HR-EIMS, H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, NOESY, COSY, HMBC, and HMQC. Urs-12-en-3 beta-ol (alpha-amyrine) (1), Urs-12-ene-2 alpha-3 beta-diol (chamaedrydiol) (2), 3 beta-hydroxyurs-12-en-28-aldehyde (ursolic aldehyde) (3), and 12-oleanex-3 beta-ol (beta-amyrine) (4) were extracted. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were examined for antibacterial and antifungal activity and found to have zones of inhibition ranging from 0 to 11 mm against tested bacteria strains and percent inhibition ranging from 0 to 25 percent against fungus strains. Compounds 1 and 4 showed strong efficacy against the investigated fungal species, with a 25% inhibition rate. In the case of antibacterial activity, compounds 4 and 1 showed potent activity with zones of inhibition of 11 mm and 10 mm, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 were observed to have nonsignificant antimicrobial activity. However, docking studies reflected the complex formation of compound 1 with beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB and S. aureus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and compound 2 with topoisomerase II DNA gyrase complex, and they were reported to have antibacterial properties. Similarly, compound 4 was discovered to be well compatible with the lanosterol 14-demethylase (fungal enzyme) and is thus regarded as having antifungal capabilities. Chimera software was used to identify the binding pockets of these complexes.

Objectives: This study aimed to examine the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the aerial part of S. platystegia and to determine the phytochemical constituents of its extract and essential oil. Methods: The ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods were used to examine the antioxidant effects of fractions obtained from the hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial part of S. platystegia. The antibacterial activity screening was also performed using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. The phytochemical constituents of the most active fractions were investigated using column chromatography. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and UV-Vis spectral analysis were used to determine the chemical structure of the isolated compounds. The GC-MS technique was also employed to identify the essential oil composition of the plant. Results: In the antioxidant activity assay, the n-butanol fraction was the most potent fraction, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 16.14 +/- 0.8 mu g/mL on the DPPH assay and 736.4 +/- 4.6 mmol FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O equivalent per gram of sample on the FRAP assay. The n-butanol fraction exhibited very strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Shigella dysenteriae (inhibition zone diameter: 20 - 25 mm, MIC: 125 - 250 mu g/mL). The phytochemical analysis of the most active fractions resulted in the isolation of the following components from the chloroform fraction: 5,7,2'-trihydroxy-8,6'-dimethoxyflavone; 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,2',6'-pentamethoxyflavone; 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone; 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-6,7,8trimethoxyflavone; and 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone. Besides, the following components were extracted from the n-butanol fraction: luteolin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside; verbascoside; apigenin; kaempferol; caffeic acid; rosmarinic acid; apigenin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside; apigenin-7-O-beta-D-(-6 ''-(E)-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside; and luteolin.

As a result, efforts are now being made to discover bioactive compounds in natural antiviral plants. For a long time, Verbascum thapsus L. has been used to relieve various lung illnesses and is traditionally used to treat certain respiratory diseases. Methods: In this study, we examined the antiviral activities (against the HCov-229E, HBV, and HSV II) by realtime RT-PCR, antibacterial activities (against Streptococcus pneumonia ATCC 1659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Haemophilus influenza ATCC 10211) by disk diffusion method, and anticancer activities (against prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines) by SRB assay of the methanol extract of V. thapsus L. leaves and flowers. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is performed to annotate the secondary metabolites in leaves and flowers. Results: The latter analysis reported the annotation of 31 secondary metabolites classified into different classes. Among these metabolites, 12 tentatively identified metabolites were reported for the first time in V. thapsus L., but some had previously been found in other Verbascum species. Some flavonoids, phenyl-ethanoid glycoside, and iridoids enhanced the flowers extract as a potent antiviral activity against the HCov-229E, HBV, and HSV II, reaching about 8-folds, 2-folds, and 4-folds reductions, respectively than that of the leaves extract, upon compared to the positive control. On the other hand, the leaves extract had a 5-fold higher antiviral impact against HCV than the flowers extract. Due to its richness in particular phenyl-ethanoid glycosides, phenolic acids, and terpenoid, the methanol extract of leaves had slightly stronger antibacterial activity (50-62%) than that of the flowers (42-54%). Both leaves and flower extracts demonstrated weak cytotoxic activity (<= 10%). Conclusion: This plant has emerged as a strong future alternative for testing against numerous enveloped viruses as a natural, affordable, accessible, and compelling medication or adjuvant.

This study aims to investigate the potential application of the stems and leaves of Astragalus membranaceus (AMSL) in food preservation. Antibacterial activity of AMSL was evaluated by the disk diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, and then the activity stability at different conditions (temperatures, pHs and ultraviolet irradiations) was analyzed and the antibacterial mechanism was revealed. Chemical composition of the active substances was also identified by UPLC-MS/MS. The results showed that the extracts from AMSL had low activities against Geotrichum candidum and Escherichia coli, while good action on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus flavus, and Candida albicans. In contrast, the ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) of AMSL was the most active against Bacillus subtilis with a diameter of inhibition zone of 15.75 mm and the MIC value of 12.5 mg/mL. EAF exhibited good stability against heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min, 60 min exposure to UV light, and it was effective in pH range of 2.0-6.0. After treating by EAF, the growth of the Bacillus subtilis was inhibited with delayed logarithmic phase, and the cell wall and the cell membrane of the bacteria were damaged deduced from the increased extracellular activity of alkaline phosphatase, the leakage of nucleic acids, and the increase of extracellular conductivity. Further SEM and TEM analysis confirmed the destroying of the cell wall integrity and cell membrane permeability with visually wrinkled even empty cells caused by EAF. Subsequent analysis revealed that flavonoids were the predominant components of EAF, followed by organic acids.

Considering the short time interval from the setting of the fruit to the harvest stage, the present study evaluates the nutritional value, chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of okra seeds from genotypes cultivated under Mediterranean conditions, as an alternative end-use product. For this purpose, seeds from four okra cultivars and local landraces commonly cultivated in the Mediterranean basin, as well as seeds from four commercial cultivars from North America were collected at the maturity stage. A significant variation between the studied okra genotypes was observed for all the evaluated parameters. Okra seeds of cv. Silver Queen are a significant source of proteins and minerals, such as Ca, K, Fe and Zn. Seeds of all the genotypes contained significant amounts of gamma-tocopherols, liposoluble pigments, and linoleic and palmitic acid. The total phenol content differed between the studied genotypes and correlated with the EC50 values of the Reducing Power assay. Seed extracts exhibited significant antibacterial properties, especially against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, while fungistatic and fungicidal properties were better than ketoconazole in a genotype dependent manner. The antifungal properties of seeds were noticed towards all tested fungi, where Aspergillus versicolor and Caldosporium cladosporioides were the most sensitive species. Moreover, two of the tested genotypes (Boyati and Clemson Spineless) exhibited higher fungistatic and fungicidal properties than ketoconazole.

This includes the bark of Juglans regia. The present study is aimed at evaluating for the first time the mineral composition, investigating the antidiabetic and antibacterial properties of Moroccan J. regia bark, and finally determining the correlations between the chemical composition of the tested extracts and their biological activities. The mineral composition was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Then, nine extracts were prepared by different methods and modalities of extractions and investigated for their antidiabetic activities, via tests of inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and beta-galactosidase enzymes, and for their antibacterial activities against six strains involved in infectious diseases and periodontology. Finally, the correlation between the chemical compositions of the different extracts prepared and their antidiabetic and antibacterial potencies was determined by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). J. regia is an important source of mineral elements, mainly Fe (19849.8), K (3487.8), Mg (2631.03), and P (691.02) mg/kg plant material. All the extracts of J. regia possess antidiabetic activity, and in particular, the macerated acetone extract gave the highest inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase (IC50 value of 5445:33 +/- 82:58 mu g/mL), alpha-glucosidase (IC50 value of 323:7 +/- 1:71 mu g/mL), and beta-galactosidase (IC50 value of 811:2 +/- 8:32 mu g/mL).

In this study, the in vitro antiproliferative activity of native currant and lemon aspen extracts (water and ethanol) against MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells was determined using the Alamar blue assay. The most potent extracts (native currant water, NC-W; native currant ethanol, NC-Et; lemon aspen ethanol, LA-Et) were further evaluated using flow cytometry to detect the potential induction of apoptosis in MCF7 cells whereas 2 ',7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) assay was implemented to understand the impact of the extracts on the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MCF7 cells. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the extracts was assessed using ABTS [2,2 '-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate)], and CUPRAC (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity) assays. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of NC-W, NC-Et, and LA-Et was carried out against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli), and yeast (Candida albicans) strains using a resazurin-based assay. Additionally, potential metabolites in the NC-W and NC-Et extracts were analysed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) driven metabolomics and chemometrics to spot differential and major metabolites. A dose-dependent antiproliferative activity was conferred by the NC extracts against MCF7 cells. Of the two LA extracts, only LA-Et showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity at higher concentrations. Both NC extracts and LA-Et induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells. None of the extracts increased the production of ROS significantly in MCF7 cells compared to the untreated control. A dose-dependent antioxidant activity was observed in both antioxidant assays. Both NC and LA extracts showed a similar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value against S. aureus. Only LA-Et showed activity against E. coli, while NC-W and NC-Et were less active.

Runemark,"The Mediterranean basin is abundant in wild edible species with numerous health beneficial effects due to the presence of various bioactive phytochemicals. In the present work, the effect of nitrogen fertilization rates (0 ppm, (NO), 200 ppm (N1), 400 ppm (N2), and 600 ppm (N3) of total N) and growth substrate composition (soil or peat/perlite (2/1; v/v)) on the chemical composition and bioactive properties of Centaurea raphanina ssp. mixta plants was evaluated. The results of the study showed that both the tested factors affected nutritional value of the edible leaves, with the soil x N1 treatment being the most beneficial for fat, protein, and carbohydrate content and energetic value. On the other hand, the peat/perlite-grown plants that received 200 ppm of N had the highest content in alpha-, gamma-, and total tocopherols, while the control treatment of soil-grown plants was the richest in individual and total sugars. Oxalic, citric, and total organic acids were the highest in the N2 x soil treatment, while malic acid was the highest in control treatment of the same substrate. The main fatty acids were palmitic, alpha-linolenic, and linoleic acids, with the highest contents being observed in the NO x soil, N3 x soil, and N3 x peat/perlite treatments, respectively. The major phenolic compounds were pinocembrim neohesperidoside and pinocembrim acetyl neohesperidoside isomer II, with the highest content being observed in the N1 x soil treatment. The highest antihemolytic activity was observed in the N3 x peat/perlite treatment, while the most effective treatments against lipid peroxidation were NO (in both soil and peat/perlite combinations) and N1 x peat/perlite. Lastly, all the tested extracts (except for N1 x soil) showed promising cytotoxic effects against HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), and NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung cancer), while all the tested extracts exhibited better antifungal activities (lower minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values) against Trichoderma viride than the positive controls.

We report here the content and composition (by HPLC) of Ixora coccinea Linn. root methanol extract (ICME) and its fractions separated by petroleum ether (ICPEF), chloroform (ICCFF), and ethyl acetate (ICEAF). Antioxidant capacity of all root samples have been evaluated by conventional radical scavenging (DPPH) and reducing power (FRAP) tests, as well as by electrochemical method using cyclic voltammetry (CV). In addition, antimicrobial activities of root samples were also determined against pathogenic bacterial strains. All samples showed considerable antioxidant activity, however, ICEAF and ICME were the most active samples in DPPH and FRAP, which were comparable to ascorbic acid and better than BHT. Both samples also showed potent superoxide anion (O-2(center dot)) radical scavenging activity in CV. All extracts displayed significant antibacterial activity against all test stains except Escherichia coli, where ICCFF showed highest inhibition against Shigella dysentriae. Both ICEAF and ICME contained higher quantities of total phenols, flavonoids, proanthocyandins and tannins than other samples. HPLC analysis showed that both samples contained 7 identified phenolic compounds, of which pyrocatechol, catechin, and chlorogenic acid were most abundant.

Results showed that polar fraction contains a highest polyphenol, flavonoid and tannin contents (14.2 mg GAE g(-1) DW, 4.8 and 4.6 mg CE g(-1) DW, respectively). The higher phenolic content in this fraction reflect the best total antioxidant capacity (8.8 mg GAE g(-1) DW), antiradical activity, beta-carotene bleaching and Fe-reducing tests with the lowest IC50 and EC50 values as compared to apolar fraction. However, chloroformic fraction was more efficient against pathogen strains. In fact, this fraction was active against all strains. Whereas, polar extract exhibited slight and moderate antibacterial activity (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, respectively). The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that salicylic and transcinnamic acids were the major phenolics. The major fatty acids were palmitic, elaidic and linoleic acids.

Design/methodology/approach The fruit samples were harvested from Ziziphus lotus L. in three regions of Morocco: Ain Chifae (Immouzer), Saiss (Fez) and Guercif. The fruit extracts were obtained by Soxhlet method using ethanol, methanol and water, and then a phytochemical screening was done for each extract. Total phenolic and total flavonoids contents were also determined. Afterward, the antimicrobial activity of the studied extracts was evaluated using the broth microdilution method. To estimate the total antioxidant effect of these extracts, the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging and phosphomolybdate tests were performed. Findings Results showed that the highest content of polyphenols and flavonoids was found for ethanol and methanol extracts, while the lowest content was found in the aqueous extracts for all populations studied. Thus, results showed that the highest content of phenolic compounds was recorded in the population of Fez. Methanol extract of this population was the richest in polyphenols (30.36 mg/g) and in flavonoids (13.03 mg/g). The antimicrobial tests showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most sensitive (6.25 mg/ml), compared to the other tested strains. Based on the minimal bactericidal concentrations/minimal fungicidal concentration or MFC/MIC ratio, it seems that ethanol extracts showed a bactericidal effect against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillis, and a bacteriostatic effect against Enterococcus faecalis. On the other hand, the methanol extract showed bacteriostatic effect against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Owing to the huge demand for bioactive natural components, it is fundamental to study in detail the composition of this kind of plants. In this vein, the phenolic fraction of grains and stems from R. sphaerocarpa grown in Algeria was thoroughly investigated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). The extracts obtained by methanol:water (50:50) extraction were also evaluated for their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The UHPLC-MS analysis allowed the identification of forty two compounds, with twenty one identified in grains and twenty six in stems extracts. Thirty one of these components are referenced for the first time as constituents of R. sphaerocarpa. Stems showed to contain a considerably higher amount of phenolic compounds (11.40 g kg(-1) of dry weight). Piscidic acid was identified as the major component, followed by quinic acid and morin/quercetin-di-O-rhamnoside. A taxifolin isomer, isorhamnetin-O-hexoside and an apigenin-6,8-di-C-hexoside isomer were found to be the major phenolic compounds in R. sphaerocarpa grains. The studied samples exhibited moderated antioxidant activities, with stems extract showing the most promising results. This fraction of R. sphaerocarpa also exhibited relevant inhibition against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results are a relevant contribution to the valorization of R. sphaerocarpa as a valuable source of natural bioactive compounds, with recognized nutraceutical applications.

DC. is used as detoxifying, analgesic, and hemostatic herbal medicine for thousands of years. Previously pharmacological studies showed that Z. nitidum had antibacterial bioactivity, but only the MIC of a few compounds, crude extracts, and fractions were reported. In our ongoing endeavor to explore bioactive compounds, two new coumarins, 6-(3-oxo-butyl)-limettin (1) and toddalin I (2), and 24 known compounds were isolated from the roots of Z. nitidum, in which two isoquinoline alkaloids, 6-acetonyl-dihydrofagaridine (16) and 6-acetonyl-dihydrochelerythrine (17) showed anti-MRSA bioactivity in vitro and in vivo. Both 16 and 17 showed synergistic action with ampicillin, which decreased the MIC significantly, and both compounds had a significant ability to destroy bacterial biofilm combined with ampicillin.

Pulverized root sample of Senna occidentalis (fam. leguminaceae) was extracted with methanol using a maceration method. The crude methanol extract (MSo) 6.06 g was partitioned into petroleum ether and ethyl acetate to yield their respective fractions viz: petroleum ether fraction (1.20 g), ethyl acetate fraction (1.86 g) and methanol fraction (2.92 g). The crude methanol extract was analyzed using phytochemical screening, infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry while the fractions were examined for antimicrobial properties. Phytochemical screening indicated the presence of tannins, phenolics, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, phlobatannin, and absence of steroids. The infrared spectrum revealed a broad absorption band at 3437.26 cm(-1) due to O-H symmetric stretch in polymeric alcohols, and absorption frequency of 1640.51cm(-1) of moderate intensity due to C=O stretch. Enols are easily identified by the broad H-bonded O-H stretch absorption and low C=O stretch frequency as in beta-keto enolic esters and phenol acetates, -CO-O-C= C-, (1690-1650 cm(-1)). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry identified the presence of ten compounds including n-hexadecanoic acid (23.76%), linoleic acid (1.64%), E-9-tetradecenoic acid (4.88%), octadecanoic acid, 2-(2 hydroxyethoxy) ethyl ester (6.24%) and E-2-octadecadecen-1-ol (13.74%). Similar broad spectrum antimicrobial activities were manifested by methanol and ethyl acetate fractions. Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were the most susceptible with the highest zone of inhibition of 30 mm and 28 mm respectively at minimum inhibition concentration of 1.35 x10(3) mu g/ml. The methanol fraction has the highest potency against the tested pathogens whereas the petroleum ether fraction exhibited activity only on gram negative pathogens.

In terms of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase inhibition, and reducing power, the n-butanol fraction was found to have the highest inhibition and reducing capability. For the antimicrobial test, the ethyl acetate fraction demonstrated antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 250 mu g/ml. In addition, the n-butanol fraction inhibits Staphylococcuepidermidis effectively (MIC value of 8 mu g/ml).

M. latifolium is widely distributed in semi-arid Bahia (Brazil) but reports on its biological activity and chemical composition are absent. In this context, our aim was to evaluate the preliminary chemical constitution and biological activity of M. latifolium stem bark. Overall, ethyl acetate fraction of M. latifolium stem bark (EAFML) was the most effective in reducing DPPH* (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) and ABTS*(+) (2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid cation radical) radicals in vitro (IC50 = 8.4 and 4.6 mu g/mL, respectively) and protecting H2O2-exposed Raw 264.7 macrophages against cell death. Similarly, EAFML enhanced the heme oxygenase activity of Raw 264.7 macrophages in concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of Nrf2 pathway. EAFML demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = MBC = 250 ptg/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC = 50 mu g/mL and MBC = 100 mu g/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC = MBC = 100 mu g/mL), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC = MBC = 100 mu g/mL) when compared among other fractions. In addition, proliferation of HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast carcinoma), and HET116 (human colon carcinoma) tumor cells were significantly reduced by EAFML (IC50 = 26.4, 19.9, and 22.1 mu g/mL, respectively), with no evidence of toxicity against non-tumor cells (MCR5, human fibroblast) and Raw 264.7 macrophages. Classical phytochemical assays and UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of quercetin-type flavonols and oleanane-type triterpenoids in the EAFML, which may be related to its biological activities. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the variety of biological properties of M. latifolium stem bark, indicating its therapeutic potential as source of molecules for treatment of oxidative and infectious disorders, as well as cancer.

Biofilm is a complex microbial population protected by exopolysaccharides (EPS), which presents with adaptive resistance against antimicrobials. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a methanolic extract of Mangifera indica seed kernels (MISK) against uropathogenic bacteria collected from urine samples. In total, n = 21 uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains were identified from n = 30 urine samples. Among the n = 21 strains, n = 17 E. coli strains were biofilm-producers in different in vitro model systems (tube-based method, microtiter-plate based method, Congo Red Agar, EPS production). Uropathogens were identified by traditional microbiological methods. MISK is a potential natural source of phytochemicals such as carbohydrates, proteins, stearic and linoleic acids. In the present study, 50 lg/mL and 100 lg/mL of methanolic extract of MISK exhibited prominent antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against the clinical UPEC strains. In addition, qualitative phytochemical characterization of methanolic extract of MISK showed the presence of bioactive compounds such as tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, carbohydrates, polyphenols, and glycosides. Moreover, the characterization of the methanolic extract by UV-VIS, FTIR, and GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of a phenolic profile, namely mangiferin (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone-C2 -b-D-glucoside). Furthermore, in silico analysis was also investigated to validate that mangiferin can bind to the specific active sites of CAMP LpxC in E. coli. Based on the collective findings of our in vitro and in silico analyses, mangiferin may be the principal compound responsible for the anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm effects of the extract. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Among the identified bacterial species, S. aureus and S. mutansshowed strong biofilm producing capacity. The other isolated bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius showed moderate biofilm formation. These pathogens were subjected for the production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in nutrient broth medium and the strain S. aureus synthesized more amounts of EPS (610 +/- 11.2 mg/ml) than S. sanguis (480 +/- 5.8 mg/ml).EPS production was found to be less in S. salivarius (52 +/- 3.8 mg/ml).The solvent extract of A. sativum bulb showed the phytochemicals such as, carbohydrate, total protein, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins and sterioids. The solvent extract of A. sativum bulb showed wide ranges of activity against the selected dental pathogens. The difference in antibacterial activity of the solvent extract revealed differences in solubility of phytochemicals in organic solvents. Ethanol extract was highly active againstS. aureus (25 +/- 2 mm).

The present study is carried out for the first time on Chamaerops humilis L. var. argentea Andre from the region of Taza using an ethnopharmacological survey, an experimental study of the mineralogical and chemical compositions, and evaluations of the antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Methods. After conducting the ethnopharmacological survey, a mineralogical and phytochemical study involving the preparation of aqueous and organic extracts was done. Essential oils were also extracted by hydrodistillation. Subsequently, qualitative and quantitative chemical analyses were performed. In vitro evaluation of antioxidant activities was performed by five tests (H2O2, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and RP) and antibacterial activities by the disc method and determination of MIC and MBC. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to visualize the different correlations. Results. The different parts of the plant are used for the treatment of digestive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. In addition, the leaves are rich in mineral compounds, catechic tannins, flavonoids, and sterols. However, they have some traces of essential oils. The quantitative analysis revealed that the ethanolic macerated had a higher content of total polyphenols (100.27 +/- 1.95 mg EAG/g E) and catechic tannins (52.11 +/- 1.02 mg EC/g E). This extract had a strong antioxidant capacity (H2O2 (37.34 +/- 0.55%), DPPH (IC50=31.18 +/- 0.66 mu g/ml), ABTS (108.28 +/- 1.29 mg E AA/g E), FRAP (148.85 +/- 0.43 mg E T/g E), and RP (10.86 +/- 0.01 mg E AA/g E). The same extract had a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that antioxidant activity was highly correlated with the chemical composition of C. humilis leaves; a high correlation was recorded between the total polyphenol content and ABTS (r=0.9779), FRAP (r=0.9644), DPPH (r=0.9418), and PR (r=0.9271) tests. In addition, cathectic tannins were highly correlated with the tests of DPPH (r=0.9753) and ABTS (r=0.8843). Flavonoids were similarly correlated with DPPH (r=0.8897) and ABTS (r=0.7599) tests.

Methods: Total polyphenols were determined using the methods reported by Singleton and Rossi (1965) and modified by Waterman and Mole (1994). Tannins were determined using vanillin HCL methods described by Prince et al. (1978). Total antioxidants were determined using the methods described by Awika et al. (2004). The micro dilution technique using 96-well micro-plates, as described by Eloff (1998) was used to obtain the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) values of the ethanol extracts against the microorganisms under study. The microbes strain used was Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coil, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris Serratia marcescens Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia; Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungus Candida albicans. Results: The results demonstrated that special tea contains significantly higher content of total polyphenols (8.34 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.83 mg/100 g) as compared to bush tea [total polyphenols (6.41 mg/100g) and total antioxidant (0.63 mg/100g)] and combination of bush tea and special tea [total polyphenols (6.42 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.64 mg/100 g). There was no significant difference in tannins between bush tea, special tea and synergy. The results of antimicrobial activity (MIC and MMC) demonstrated that the ethanol extracts of bush tea, special tea and synergy possessed antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms at different zones. The MIC of bush tea ranged from 1.56 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.78 to 12.50 mg/mL. Special tea's MIC ranged from 0.39 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.01 to 12.50 mg/mL. The MIC of synergy ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL without positive synergistic effect recorded. Conclusions: Both bush and special tea contain total polyphenols, total antioxidants and tannins with special tea containing a significantly higher total polyphenols and total antioxidant as compared to bush tea and synergy.

The combined action of LAB (lactic acid bacteria) and raspberry preparations on the pathogenic species was also evaluated. The results of our study showed no or weak antibacterial effect of raspberry preparations on the pathogenic bacteria tested. Regardless of preparation concentration (1.0 or 2.0 mg/mL), the bacteria number after 48-h incubation was usually higher than in the culture at the initial stage and varied from 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/mL. On the other hand, probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain caused a significant reduction in the enteric pathogen count after 24-h co-culture with LAB. The concentrations of both Salmonella serotypes were below the detection limit of the analytical methods applied. Moreover, the combined use of LAB and raspberry preparations resulted in the total elimination of Salmonella strains and the reduction in L. monocytogenes number from 10(5) to 10(2)-10(4) cfu/mL after 24-h co-culture.

Materials and methods: To substantiate the folkloric claims, an acetone, 50:50 acetone:methanol and 2:1 chloroform:methanol extracts were tested against Escherichia coli K12; acetone extract and the fractions of acetone extracts were tested against Listeria monocytogenes. Bioassay-guided fractionation was performed on the extract using L monocytogenes as the test organism to isolate the bioactive compounds which were then tested against all the other organisms. Results: Four known labdane diterpenes (G3 and G5) were isolated for the first time from the rhizomes of A. melegueta and purified. These were tested against E. coli, L monocytogenes, methicillin resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA) and S. aureus to determine antibacterial activity. The result showed that two compounds G3 and G5 exhibited more potent antibacterial activity compared to the current clinically used antibiotics ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin and can be potential antibacterial lead compounds. The structure of the labdane diterpenes were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Mass spectrometry. A possible mode of action of the isolated compound G3 and its potential cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells were also discussed. Conclusion: The results confirmed the presence of antibacterial compounds in the rhizomes of A. melegueta with a favourable toxicity profile which could be further optimized as antibacterial lead compounds.

However, whether these extracts can serve as natural antimicrobial and chemopreventive agents is still a question. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial and antiproliferative efficacy of SWE kanuka leaf extracts. Subcritical water extraction (SWE) was used to obtain natural extracts from kanuka leaves potentially rich in biologically active compounds. The antibacterial and antiproliferative capacities were assessed by broth microdilution assay and MTT-assay, respectively. The assessed properties were compared to extraction from ethanol extraction (EE). Results The screening results for antibacterial properties demonstrated that subcritical water kanuka leaf extracts were active against Escherichia coli (minimum conc. 0.8 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (minimum conc. 3.8 mg/mL). These extracts also exerted dose-dependent antiproliferative effects on the viability of cancerous human cervical cell lines (Hep-2 and RD cells) and mouse cell lines (L cells). The extraction temperature had significantly affected the extract's activities by enhancing neoformed compounds with beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS Subcritical water extracts of kanuka demonstrated a better efficacy against bacterial growth and malignant cells viability in comparison to extracts obtained using conventional ethanol extraction.

This herb is commonly used by local practitioners in traditional Asian medicine.Methods: In the present investigation, the novel Kaempferia galanga rhizome essential oil rich in ethyl p-methoxy cinnamate (EMCKG) was evaluated using GC/MS for chemical composition analysis. EMCKG was analyzed for its possible antimicrobial, neurodegenerative inhibitory, acetylcholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities as well as for the genotoxic effects using the standard methodologies. ANOVA and post hoc was performed to test the statistical significance of the study.Results: GC/MS analysis identified ethyl p-methoxy cinnamate as the major component of EMCKG essential oil with an area percentage of 66.39%. The EMCKG exhibited moderate (DPPH assay IC50 = 15.64 +/- 0.263 mu g/mL; ABTS assay IC50 = 16.93 +/- 0.228 mu g/mL) antioxidant activity than standard ascorbic acid (DPPH assay IC50 = 21.24 +/- 0.413 mu g/mL; ABTS assay IC50 = 21.156 +/- 0.345 mu g/mL). Similarly, EMCKG showed comparable activity in albumin denaturation (IC50 = 2.93 +/- 0.59 mu g/mL) and protease inhibitor assay (IC50 = 17.143 +/- 0.506 mu g/mL) to that of standard sodium diclofenac (IC50 = 23.87 +/- 0.729 mu g/mL and IC50 = 19.18 +/- 0.271 mu g/mL, respectively). The EMCKG exhibited a dose-dependent antimicrobial activity pattern with the highest inhibitory activity at 500 mu g/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and considerable anticholinesterase activities (IC50 = 21.94 +/- 0.109 mu g/mL) compared to the standard galanthamine (IC50 = 27.18 +/- 0.511 mu g/mL). EMCKG also showed strong anti-diabetic activity (IC50 = 18.503 +/- 0.480 mu g/mL) and anti-tyrosinase activity (IC50 = 14.756 +/- 0.325 mu g/mL) as compared to the standards used (acarbose IC50 = 20.39 +/- 0.231 mu g/mL and kojic acid IC50 = 17.73 +/- 0.192 mu g/ mL) in the study. Genotoxicity analysis of EMCKG revealed that at 1 mu g/mL concentration has no toxic effects in mitosis of Allium cepa roots (Mitotic Index MI = 13.56% and chromosomal aberration CA = 07.60%). The ANOVA confirmedthat except for the anticholinesterase activity, there is insignificant difference for essential oil and standards used for all the other bioactivities thus confirming their interchangeable applicability. Conclusions: Current research provides the basis for the fact that besides being a rich source of ethyl p-methoxycinnamate, EMCKG has the potential for future formulation and development of an inexpensive skin-care agent and for the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs.",PEERJ,PEERJ INC,Anti-diabetic; Antimicrobial; Essential oil; Genotoxicity; Neurodegenerative; Ethyl p-methoxycinnamate,CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; LARVICIDAL ACTIVITY; METHANOLIC EXTRACT; RESISTANT STRAINS; GUIDED ISOLATION; RHIZOME; METHOXYCINNAMATE; ZINGIBERACEAE; LEAVES,"[Begum, Twahir; Gogoi, Roktim; Sarma, Neelav; Kumar, Sudin; Pandey, Sudin Kumar; Lal, Mohan] CSIR, North East Inst Sci & Technol, Agrotechnol & Rural Dev Div, Jorhat, Assam, India; [Begum, Twahir; Gogoi, Roktim; Sarma, Neelav; Kumar, Sudin; Pandey, Sudin Kumar] AcSIR Acad Scienti fi c & Innovat Res, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India",Kaempferia galanga,,Zingiberaceae,,"noise, isolated compounds","noise, isolated compounds",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Kaempferia galanga,Zingiberaceae,Kaempferia,India

Apigenin-7-O-glucoside and chlorogenic acid were identified in practically all C. vulgare extracts. Extracts from leaves collected at the end of the phenological dormancy period and in the first growing year had the highest antioxidant (cupric ion-reducing antioxidant capacity of 12,938 Trolox equivalents/g dry weight) and antimicrobial activity (against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Candida albicans) with MIC values of ethanol extract from 16.7 mg/mL to 8.35 mg/mL. These extracts included a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and apigenin-7-O-glucoside. Also, dry extracts from C. vulgare roots and inflorescences showed a higher antimicrobial effect compared to ethanolic extracts with MIC values from 5.57 mg/mL to 3 mg/mL. The study emphasizes the critical role of phenological stages and raw material composition in the accumulation of phenolic compounds and their biological activity in C. vulgare.

Honey-based products with lyophilizates were developed to enhance the relatively limited therapeutic potential of rapeseed honey by incorporating fruit lyophilizates known to possess bioactive compounds. The moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, free acidity, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and mineral composition were analyzed. Sour cherry-enriched honey exhibited the highest total phenolic content (TPC = 102 +/- 0.18 mg GAE/100 g), while blueberry-enriched honey had the highest total flavonoid content (TFC = 34.9 +/- 0.89 mg CAE/100 g) and total anthocyanin content (TAC = 299 +/- 3.14 mg EC/100 g), with the greatest relative scavenging capacity (81.0 +/- 0.46% of DPPH inhibition). Polyphenol profiling identified phenolic acids and flavonoids, with raspberry-enriched honey showing the highest total polyphenol content (47.0 +/- 0.98 mg/kg) due to its high ellagic acid content (38.4 +/- 1.11 mg/kg). All honey-based products demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

In 96% ethanol, nine out of ten studied plant infusions had antibacterial effect against L. monocytogenes, but in 20% ethanol only the infusions of dark rhubarb roots had a similar effect. Chokeberry and other berries had the highest antioxidative activity, both in 20% and 96% ethanol infusions. CONCLUSION The combination of dark rhubarb roots or petioles and berries of black chokeberry, blackcurrant or some other anthocyanin-rich berries would have potential as both antibacterial and antioxidative additives in food.

Artichoke cultivation generates substantial by-products, including leaves, stems, and roots, which could serve as valuable sources of biomolecules and prebiotic dietary fiber. To valorize the leaf waste of the Carciofo Ortano landrace, a multidisciplinary approach was applied. Chemical analysis using HPLC-DAD identified mono-O- and di-O-caffeoylquinic acids and the sesquiterpene cynaropicrin in all artichoke leaf extracts. SPME-GC/MS analyses detected aliphatic alcohols in the fresh leaf samples. Antiproliferative and cytotoxic studies on cancer (SH-SY5Y, MCF-7, MDA) and normal (MCF-10A) human cell lines revealed that leaf extracts induced a selective dose and time-dependent biological effect. While showing slight activity against environmental bacterial strains, artichoke leaf extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata.

This paper presents a comparative study of the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of RA sample extract to that of Zingiber officinale (ZO) and Curcuma longa (CL). Methods: Phytochemical screening tests were, first, done using different confirmatory tests prior to quantitative determinations. Quantitative determinations were then conducted-the total phenolic content by the Prussian blue method, total flavonoid content by the aluminum colorimetric assay, and antioxidant activity by the reducing power assay and the cyclic voltammetry technique. Results: All of the samples showed positive tests, with different intensities, for the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, glycosides and tannins, but not for alkaloids. The total phenolic content, the total flavonoid content and the antioxidant activities of RA (in mg/100 g dry weight) were found to be 319.208 +/- 15.997, 113.252 +/- 1.702 and 45.632 +/- 2.026, respectively. On the other hand, both oxidation and reduction peaks were observed in the cyclic voltammetry analysis of the herbs, showing a quasi-reversible redox process of their phenolic compounds. The determination of the inhibition zones (in mm) of ethanol extract of RA was found to be 20.33 +/- 0.58, 21.67 +/- 0.58, 19.17 +/- 0.29, 18.17 +/- 0.29, and 21.67 +/- 0.58 against Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli, and Shigella flexneri bacteria strains, respectively. Conclusion: The substantial antioxidant and antibacterial activities of RA compared to ZO and CL indicate that the traditional use of the herb to refine butter and keep it safe longer without rancidity formation and other traditional medicinal practices can be attributed to both its antioxidant and antibacterial activities.",CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE,SPRINGER,Phytochemical screening; Antioxidant activity; Antibacterial activity; Rumex abyssinicus; Zingiber officinale; Curcuma longa,ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; EXTRACTS; PLANT; CAPACITY; ASSAYS; HERBS; FOOD; L.,"[Mekonnen, Alemayehu] Bahir Dar Univ, Sci Coll, Dept Chem, POB 79, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Desta, Welday] Samara Univ, Sci Coll, Dept Chem, Semera, Ethiopia","Curcuma longa, Zingiber officinale, Rumex abyssinicus",,"Zingiberaceae, Zingiberaceae, Polygonaceae",,"phenolics, noise, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids","phenolics, noise, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids","Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli","positive, negative, negative",,"Curcuma longa, Zingiber officinale, Rumex abyssinicus","Zingiberaceae, Zingiberaceae, Polygonaceae","Curcuma, Zingiber, Rumex",Ethiopia

Overall, methanol possessed superior total extraction efficiency. HPLC analyses confirmed the efficacy of acetone and ethanol as optimal solvents for the extraction of flavonoids and flavan-3-ols, whereas MAE exhibited enhanced effectiveness in extracting N-containing compounds, including 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). HPLC-MS analyses identified forty-three compounds, including thirty-four phenolic compounds and nine N-containing molecules. Isomyricitrin, taxifolin and a flavonol glucuronide were the main polyphenols, whereas 5-HTP was the main N-containing compound. Hydroalcoholic G. simplicifolia extracts showed the highest radical scavenging and metal-reducing antioxidant power, suggesting that most of the contribution to antioxidant activity depends on the more polar bioactive compounds. G. simplicifolia extracts showed dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against three distinct cancer cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, and MCF-7), with notable variations observed among both the different extracts and cell lines and divergent GI(50) values, emphasizing substantial discrepancies in cell sensitivity to the various extracts.

E. hirsuta was active especially against bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Agrobacterium tumefaciens and fungi Puncturella fastigiata, while C dorycniifolia was active against bacteria E. faecalis and had moderate activity against Trichoderma species. The extracts displayed strong antigenotoxic effects (98.6% for E. hirsuta and 76.3% for C dorycniifolia). Our findings suggested that C dorycniifolia and E. hirsuta could be beneficial for the preparation of high-value pharmaceuticals and functional food ingredients. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Research has demonstrated that this by-product is abundant in valuable nutritional compounds. Various extraction methods are employed to enhance the value of industrial waste by recovering its bioactive compounds. The study aims to optimize the extraction of polyphenols utilizing an infrared technique Ired-Irrad (R) (IR), in comparison to the water bath (WB) extraction. To optimize the extraction of polyphenols from SSC using both the IR and WB extraction methods, the study utilized Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Under optimal conditions, IR extraction resulted in an improved polyphenol yield, which was 20% higher than that obtained using WB extraction. Similarly, the antiradical activity, quantified as mg of Trolox equivalent per milliliter, increased from 0.58 mg TE/mL in the WB extract to 0.68 mg TE/mL in the IR extract. The phytochemical profile of the IR and WB extracts was examined through High -Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The major polyphenols identified in both extracts were the flavonoids rutin (3.87 mg/L in IR, 1.72 mg/L in WB) and catechin (3.05 mg/L in IR, 1.32 mg/L in WB). The IR extract revealed the highest yield of polyphenols among the majority of compounds, compared to WB. The lyophilized SSC extracts obtained through both the IR and WB methods demonstrated the most effective antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes , with a minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) value exceeding 100 mg/mL. However, minor antibacterial effects were detected against the Gram-negative strains, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7, for extracts obtained with both the IR and WB methods.",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH,ELSEVIER,Sesamum indicum; Sesame seed coat; Polyphenols; Ired-irrad (R); Antibacterial activity,ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; PLANT-EXTRACTS; SOLVENT; TEMPERATURE,"[Khazaal, Salma; Khalil, Mahmoud I.] Beirut Arab Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, POB 11-5020, Beirut, Lebanon; [Louka, Nicolas] Univ St Joseph Beyrouth, Fac Sci, Unite Rech Technol & Valorisat Agroalimentaire, Ctr Anal & Rech, BP 17-5208 Riad El Solh, Beirut 11042020, Lebanon; [Debs, Esperance] Univ Balamand, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Biol, POB 100, Tripoli, Lebanon; [Khalil, Mahmoud I.] Alexandria Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Mol Biol Unit, Alexandria 21568, Egypt; [Albiss, Borhan] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Phys, Nanomat Lab, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan; [Al-Nabulsi, Anas A.; Osaili, Tareq M.] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Nutr & Food Technol, Fac Agr, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan; [Jammoul, Adla] Lebanese Agr Res Inst, Food Dept, POB 2611, Beirut 11072809, Lebanon; [Osaili, Tareq M.] Univ Sharjah, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Nutr & Dietet, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [El Darra, Nada] Beirut Arab Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nutr & Dietet, POB 115020, Beirut 11072809, Lebanon",Sesamum indicum,,Pedaliaceae,,"phenolics, phenolics, isolated compounds, flavonoids, noise","phenolics, phenolics, isolated compounds, flavonoids, noise","Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes","negative, positive",,Sesamum indicum,Pedaliaceae,Sesamum,Lebanon

Most attention has focused on the antimicrobial activity against P-fimbriated Escherichia coli strains. The present study inves-tigated the anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activity of a saline extract of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) targeting intestinal colonization by a highly adherent Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. This strain, responsible for a large outbreak of infection in Spain, was selected on the basis of its remarkable capacity to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of patients. The blueberry extract was obtained using a medium scale ambient temperature system (MSAT) in a novel approach based on the use of an aqueous solvent and addition of mineral salts. The polyphenolic content was determined by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings confirmed that the blueberry extract is a rich source of phenolic compounds, including the most polar poly phenols (mostly non-flavonoids), intermediate polarity compounds (flavan-3-ols and most procyanidins) and low polarity compounds (flavonols and anthocyanins). The extract significantly inhibited biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to HT-29 colorectal cells by a highly adherent multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Although some individual anthocyanidins (malvidin, delphinidin and cyanidin) and one hydroxycinnamic acid (caffeic acid) proved capable of reducing bacterial adhesion, the unfractionated extract was more active than any of the individual polyphenolic compounds. In addition, the extract displayed considerable potential as an intestinal decolonization treatment in a murine model.

In order to study their phenolic profiles, polar extracts of buds from P. nigra L. were compared to those of P. alba L and S. alba L through high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Five chemotypical patterns were distinguished after derivatisation with the Natural Product reagent and confirmed by principal component analysis. The HPTLC analysis was directly hyphenated to various microbiological and biochemical assays as well as spectrometric techniques, directly linking to active molecules in the chromatograms. At a glance, polyvalent compounds were evident when all derivatisation and activity assays, to which HPTLC was hyphenated at ease, were combined together. In Populus buds, at least three antimicrobial compound zones were detected using Aliivibrio fischeri and Bacillus subtilis bioassays, and one phyto-oestrogen with the planar yeast oestrogen screen. In all samples, several inhibitors of acetyl- and butyryicholinesterase and rabbit liver esterase were detected. Hyphenation to high resolution mass spectrometry supported the assignment of bioactive compounds, as shown for chrysin as selective cholinesterase inhibitor as well as caffeic acid and galangin as antimicrobials in P. nigra and P. alba.

This led to highlighting some of the medicinal plants used by local populations in the management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases. Two regions with the highest occurrence of HIV/AIDS cases were visited and ethnopharmarcological data was gathered. These regions were the Estuaire Province (Libreville and its neighborhood) and the Haut-Ogooue Province (Franceville and its neighborhood). The opportunistic diseases and symptomatic conditions considered during this study were: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, cough, tuberculosis, abscesses, stomach ache, skin rashes, venereal diseases, typhoid fever, anemia, general tiredness, hepatitis and vomiting. Materials and methods: The reported species were evaluated through three parameters: specificity, reliability and frequency. Plant parts of relevant species were harvested and extracted with an aqueous alcohol solution (ethanol/water: 1/1). The extracts obtained were submitted to phytochemical screening and in vitro microbiological assays on some clinical isolates and ATCC strains, involved in HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases through the Agar well diffusion and Microbroth dilution methods. Results: Among the 52 species identified during this survey, Coelocaryon klainei Pierre ex Heckel (Myristicaceae), Dacryodes klaineana (Pierre) H.J. Lam (Bursecaceae), Phyllanthus diandrus Pax (Euphorbiaceae), Saccoglotys gabonensis (Baill.) Urb. (Humiriaceae) and Tetrorchidium didymostemon (Baill.) Pax 82 K. Hoffm. (Euphorbiaceae) were submitted to in vitro microbiological assays. Phyllanthus diandrus bark and leaves show best antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae with MIC value of 0.25 respectively. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence in all the plant parts extracts of potentially bioactive molecules, including polyphenols, especially flavonoids and tannins. Conclusion: It is concluded that some of these plants might be submitted to further scientific studies, including the identification and isolation of bioactive principles, that could be developed to drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases.

(AC) leaves are widely recognized for their importance in traditional medicine. Despite the considerable amount of research conducted on this plant overworld, the chemical composition and the biological activity of the leaves grown in Tunisia remains poorly investigated. In this study of AC, a successive extraction method was employed (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol) to investigate its bioactive constituents by LC-MS analysis, and their antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities. Results Data analysis revealed diverse compound profiles in AC extracts. Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts exhibited higher polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities, while Hexane showed superior phytosterol extraction. Ethyl acetate extract displayed potent antibacterial activity against multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, all extracts demonstrated, for the first time, robust antifungal efficacy against Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Cytotoxicity assays revealed the significant impact of methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts on metastatic breast cancer and multiple myeloma, examined for the first time in our study. Moreover, further analysis on multiple myeloma cells highlighted that the ethyl acetate extract induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death and resulted in an S phase cell cycle blockage, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Conclusions This investigation uncovers novel findings in Tunisian AC, notably the identification of lupeol, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol.

Genus Sterculia is widely recognized by its phytomedicinal and ethnomedicinal attributes. The study is aimed to evaluate the qualitative analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thin layer chromatography (TLC), total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the crude hydro-methanolic extract of S. urens root. Results: The antioxidant activity, antimicrobial assay for clinical isolates, and TPC were measured by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity, agar well diffusion method, and Folin-Ciocalteu assay respectively. Hydro-methanolic extract confirmed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, saponins, steroids, and glycosides as primary and secondary metabolites, which was later confirmed by TLC. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of alkanes, alkenes, alkyl halides, halogen compounds, primary alcohol, tertiary alcohol, aldehyde, aromatic amine, secondary amines, amide group, and carboxylic acid. The crude extract was composed of a significant quantity of total phenolic content with 705 0.40mg GAE/g. Synergistically, the IC50 value of the crude extract and ascorbic acid was found to be 27.055 mu g/ml and 37.244 mu g/ml, respectively, which suggests that root extract possesses strong antioxidant properties. The majority of the microbial strains exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity to the root extract with a notable inhibitory effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Penicillium glaucum. Conclusion: The findings of this analysis suggest that the hydro-methanolic extract from S. urens root exhibit antioxidant activity quantified by its ability to scavenge DPPH; antimicrobial activity displayed appreciable microbial sensitivity. These properties are associated with the presence of high phenolic content, different secondary metabolites, and their functional groups.

An enzymolysis-ultrasonic assisted extraction (EUAE) method was developed and optimized for the extraction of Cyclocarya paliurus flavonoids in liquid form (CPF). The key factor influencing the extraction yield of Cyclocarya paliurus flavonoids was identified by two-level Plackett-Burman Design (PBD) with eight factors. Plackett-Burman Design determined the following four key factors as significant for the extraction yield of Cyclocarya paliurus flavonoids viz. Enzymatic temperature, enzymatic pH, complex enzyme concentration and ultrasonic power. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was subsequently applied to optimize the four key factors identified from Box-Behnken Design. Chemical composition of Cyclocarya paliurus flavonoids was investigated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antimicrobial activity was carried out with the disc diffusion method. Antioxidant activities were investigated by DPPH assays, O-2 center dot(-) assays, ABTS(+) assays and the reducing power. The optimal extraction conditions were as follow: enzymatic temperature of 50.71 degrees C, enzymatic pH of 5.08, complex enzyme concentration of 3.23% and ultrasonic power of 108.03 W.

Objective: This investigation aims to isolate bioactive compounds from the leaf acetone extract of Terminalia catappa and to evaluate their antimicrobial potential against human pathogenic organisms. Materials and Methods: The bioactive extract was subjected to column chromatography. The fractions were assessed for their minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and time kill assays. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify the bioactive molecules in the fraction. Results: The isolated fraction exhibited antimicrobial activity, with the most sensitive being Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus 1503 (0.097 mg/mL), and the fungi Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans were inhibited at 0.097 mg/mL. The time kill assay exhibited bactericidal properties towards S. aureus (clinical isolate) and Salmonella typhi (MTCC 733). Additionally, MRSA 1503 and Proteus vulgaris exhibited bacteriostatic activities. The UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the fraction was rich in polyphenols. Alkaloids and some ellagitannins were identified for the first time.

This study was conducted to determine the antibacterial and health-promoting potential of the phenolic rich extract (PRE)-loaded microcapsules obtained from Polygonum bistorta root as a dietary phytobiotic in mice challenged by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli).MethodThe PRE was obtained from Polygonum bistorta root using fractionation by different polarity solvents and the highest PRE was encapsulated by the combination of modified starch, maltodextrin, and whey protein concentrate as wall materials using a spray dryer. Then, the physicochemical characterization (particle size, zeta potential, Morphology and polydispersity index) of microcapsules have been assessed. For the invivo study, 30 mice at five treatment were designed and antibacterial properties were analyzed. Furthermore, relative fold changes in the ileum population of E. coli was investigated using Real time PCR.ResultsThe encapsulation of PRE resulted in the production of phenolic enriched extract-loaded microcapsules (PRE-LM) with a mean diameter of 330 nm and relatively high entrapment efficiency (87.2% w/v). The dietary supplementation of PRE-LM improved weight gain, liver enzymes, gene expression, morphometric characteristics of the ileum and decreased the population of E. coli present in the ileum significantly (p < 0.05).ConclusionOur funding suggested PRE-LM as a promising phytobiotic against E. coli infection in mice.",BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES,BMC,Phytogenic; Delivery; Antibacterial agent; Natural antibiotic; Microencapsulation; Antibiotic-alternative,ESSENTIAL OILS; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES; CAMPYLOBACTER-JEJUNI; RICH FRACTIONS; MICROENCAPSULATION; L.; EXTRACT; PROFILE; ASSAY,"[Mezerji, Zahra Kadkhoda; Boshrouyeh, Reza; Razavi, Seyedehfarnaz Hafezian; Ghajari, Shaghayegh; Hajiha, Hasti; Shafaei, Negin; Karimi, Ehsan; Oskoueian, Ehsan] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Biol, Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, Iran; [Oskoueian, Ehsan] Arka Ind Cluster, Dept Res & Dev, Mashhad, Iran",Polygonum bistorta,,Polygonaceae,,phenolics,phenolics,Escherichia coli,negative,,Polygonum bistorta,Polygonaceae,Polygonum,Iran

Ethanol extracts were most efficient at extracting phenolics, flavonoids and condensed tannins compared to hexane and distilled water for both Cistus species. A total antioxidant test (TAA) and two radical scavenging tests (DPPH and ABTS) indicated that the 70% ethanolic extract from C. salvifolius leaves had stronger antioxidant activity compared to the C. monspeliensis 70% ethanol extract, while the aqueous extract of C. monspeliensis was much stronger than the aqueous extract or the 70% ethanol extract of C. salvifolius. Overall, the polar extracts were more active in both species than the non-polar extracts. Thus aqueous ethanol extracts of the leaves of each Cistus species were tested for their ability to inhibit seven pathogenic microbial strains, including Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 6017, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans. Leaf ethanol extracts from both species were active against each microbial species, but the C. monspeliensis leaf ethanolic extract was much more active against several microbial species than that of C. salvifolius. For example, the C. salvifolius 70% ethanol extract showed its highest antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and A. niger (MIC 3.1 mg/ml and MBC 6.3 mg/ml for both), while the C. monspeliensis extract showed much higher overall activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and C. albicana.

In this work, effect of the Eucalyptus globulus and Mentha viridis extraction by different solvents on phenolics content, flavonoids content, condensed tannins content, antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect against two lipases from Aspergillus niger and olive was studied. Methanolic (MeOH) extract showed the strongest antioxidant and anti-lipase activities. High correlation between total phenolics content, total flavonoids content, antioxidant activity and lipases inhibitory action was observed. Kinetic analysis of lipases inhibition was performed with Linweaver-Burk, Dixon and Cornish-Bowden plots. These results revealed competitive inhibition mode by E. globulus and non competitive mixed inhibition mode by M. viridis against the two lipases. Inhibition constant (K-I) values calculated with E. globulus MeOH extract were 0.271 and 0.188 mg/mL for Aspergillus niger and olive lipases respectively. With M. viridis MeOH extract K-I values were 0.303 and 0.421 mg/mL for the fungal and the plant lipases respectively. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values determined with E. globulus MeOH extract were 0.69 mg/mL for Aspergillus niger lipase and 1.29 mg/mL for olive lipase.

Callistemon citrinus Skeels is an important plant of great medicinal value. Its antimicrobial activity is well documented. Although several compounds were isolated from this plant, the actual bioactive compounds responsible for its antimicrobial activity are still unrevealed. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effect of C. citrinus crude extract and isolated compounds on methicillin-resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Materials and methods: The methylene chloride-methanol extract (MME) of C. citrinus leaves was prepared by Soxhlet apparatus. Biologically guided fractionation of MME was accomplished using several normal and reversed phase silica gel columns. The potency of MME and its isolated compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) was evaluated. In addition, the mechanism of resistance was studied using three virulence factors; antibiofilm activity, inhibition of staphyloxanthin biosynthesis and effect on acid tolerance. Ultrastructural changes in MRSA and MSSA were observed by TEM to understand mode of action of these compounds. Results: Pulverulentone A (C1), 8- desmethyl eucalyptin (C2) and eucalyptin (C3) were isolated from the most bioactive fraction of MME. Confocal scanning laser microscopy images revealed that C. citrinus isolated compounds destroyed the intact architecture of biofilm, thickness and reduced its biomass. Pulverulentone A (C1) showed the most potent anti-biofilm activity up to 71% and 62.3% against MRSA and MSSA, respectively. It also exhibited the highest inhibition of staphyloxanthin biosynthesis of MRSA and MSSA by 55.6% and 54.5%, respectively. The bacterial cell membrane was compromised, losing its integrity and releasing important cellular constituents when exposed to C1-C3 Conclusions: C. citrinus phenolics and acylphloroglucinols may serve as potential source of plant-based antibacterials and thus could be implicated to control MRSA biofilm formation.",JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,Callistemon citrinus; Myrtaceae; Pulverulentone A; Microbial anti-biofilm; Staphyloxanthin biosynthesis; CLSM; TEM,"ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ESSENTIAL OIL; 1,8-CINEOLE; PHLOROGLUCINOLS; MECHANISM","[Shehabeldine, Amr M.] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci Boys, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Cairo 11884, Egypt; [Ashour, Rehab M.; Okba, Mona M.; Saber, Fatema R.] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacognosy, Kasr el Aini St, Cairo 11562, Egypt",Callistemon citrinus,,Myrtaceae,,"phenolics, noise","phenolics, noise",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Callistemon citrinus,Myrtaceae,Callistemon,Egypt

This compound is classified as 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran that features a unique, highly substituted skeleton with functional diversity. The absolute configuration was established by comparing its experimental ECD spectrum and optical rotation values with those of related neolignans. In addition, seventeen diverse phytoconstituents were identified for the first time from this plant, expanding our knowledge of its chemical composition. These included oleanane-type saponins, phenolic derivatives, lignans, and neolignans, which serve as valuable chemotaxonomic markers.

Concentrations of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total proanthocyanidin content (TPAC), and antioxidant capacity were also measured in aqueous and ethanol (EtOH) extracts. Their bioactivities in terms of antiviral (against two cell lines), antimicrobial (against eight bacteria strains), antifungal (against two fungal strains), and cytotoxic (against eight cell lines) effects were assessed. The maximum effects were found in EtOH extract of R. persica root. The main components of the R. persica essential oil (RPEO) were methyl eugenol (73.1%) and geranyl acetone (10.3%). UPLC-ESI-PDA-MSn analysis showed that gallic acid (GA) was found in the highest concentration in the EtOH extract (461.80 +/- 90.3 mu g/g). In the antiviral assay, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of EtOH extract for Coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) and Coxsackievirus B4 (CV-B4) were 29.26 +/- 0.5 and 24.70 +/- 0.2 mu g/mL, respectively. The cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) calculated for EtOH extract against both cell lines were significantly lower than aqueous extract (89.13 +/- 0.3 and 75.03 +/- 0.1 mu g/mL, respectively). The most sensitive bacteria strain in both extracts was Staphylococcus aureus. Activity in fungal strains, Candida albicans was more sensitive than Aspergillus niger. The current cytotoxicity results between the two extracts of R. persica showed that both had the highest and lowest cytotoxic activity against human glioblastoma (U-87-MG) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines, respectively.",ERWERBS-OBSTBAU,SPRINGER,Anticancer; Antimicrobial; Bioactive compounds; Coxsackieviruses; Phytochemicals,LAEVIGATA MICHX FRUIT; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; EXTRACTS; PROFILE; FLOWER; OIL; L.,"[Koohestanian, Ali; Asgharzade, Ahmad] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Hort Sci, Shirvan Branch, Shirvan, Iran; [Tatari, Maryam] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Shirvan Branch, Shirvan, Iran; [Kazemi, Malihe Samadi] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Bojnourd Branch, Bojnourd, Iran; [Taghizadeh, Seyedeh Faezeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Dept Hort Sci, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Taghizadeh, Seyedeh Faezeh] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Pharmaceut Res Ctr, Pharmaceut Technol Inst, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran",Rosa persica,,Rosaceae,,"phenolics, flavonoids, noise, flavonoids","phenolics, flavonoids, noise, flavonoids",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,"Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger",Rosa persica,Rosaceae,Rosa,Iran

Particular focus was given to A. atrata, which has hardly been studied so far. Based on the metabolite profile, A. atrata exhibited more similarities to A. moschata than to A. millefolium. The former two only differed in the occurrence of four compounds. The flavonols syringetin-3-O-glucoside and mearnsetin-hexoside, not reported for an Achillea species before, have been detected in A. atrata and A. moschata. All Achillea species reduced growth of the tested bacteria. A. atrata demonstrated highest activity against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, both being involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. Furthermore, A. atrata has a pronounced anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus potential. Bioassay-guided fractionation revealed that only the most polar fraction of A. moschata displayed antimicrobial activity, which was attributed to phenolics such as apigenin, centaureidin, and nevadensin, being present in high amounts in A. atrata.

Don","Background: Allium chinense G. Don is a medicinal and aromatic herb belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae, characterized by a high saponin content. The previous report has mostly been focused on the bulb, and there is very limited work on the leaf. The information about biological and chemical constituent of A. chinense leaf is still inadequate in contrast to the investigations reported on the bulb. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the hexane extract of both bulb and leaf extract. Therefore, the present investigation was focused on identifying and characterization of the hexane extracts of A. chinense bulb and leaf quantitatively and by using the GC-MS method and to know its scavenging, antibacterial, and antifungal activity. Results: Twenty-eight bioactive compounds were identified in the bulb and nine in the leaf extract by GC-MS analysis. The versatile compounds present in the bulb are 2-methyloctacosane (21.30%), tetracontane (14.05%), eicosane, 10-methyl (12.06%), heneicosane (8.46%), octadecyl trifluoroacetate (6.48%), and 1-heneicosanol (5.76%), whereas in the leaf, it was phytol (35.76%), tetratetracontane (18.49%), perhydrofarnesyl acetone (14.76%), and heptadecane, 2,6-dimethyl (10.79%). In quantitative estimation, saponins were estimated to have the highest with 375.000 0.577mg/g in the leaf and 163.750 +/- 0.433mg/g in the bulb. The DPPH antioxidant scavenging activity was found to be minimum in both the bulb (IC50 = 678.347 mu g/ml) and leaf (IC50 = 533.337 mu g/ml). A. chinense extracts of both leaf and bulb exerted potential antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Leaf extract exhibited greater antifungal activity than the bulb against Aspergillus niger. Conclusion: From the analysis, the hexane leaf extract exhibited higher antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activity than the bulb. Their superior activity might be due to the higher content of total saponin and terpenes.

However, it has been shown that flavonoids and mangiferin are mainly responsible for the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities closely related to the wound-healing process. The chemical composition of MEMI (methanolic extract of M. indica) was analyzed by HPLC-DAD, as well as concentrations of total phenol (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) and antioxidant activity (SA(50)). Wound-healing efficacy was determined by measurements of wound contraction, histological analysis, and tensiometric method; moreover, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and acute dermal toxicity (OECD 402) were also evaluated. Phenol, resorcinol, conjugated resorcinol, and mangiferin were detected. TPC, TFC, and SA(50) were 136 mg GAE/g, 101.66 mg QE/g, and 36.33 mu g/mL, respectively. Tensile strength and wound contraction closure did not show significant differences between MEMI and dexpanthenol groups. Histological analysis (after 14 days) shows a similar architecture between MEMI treatment and normal skin. MEMI exhibits a reduction in edema. Staphylococcus epidermidis had an MIC of 2 mg/mL, while Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli reached 4 mg/mL. The MEMI showed no signs of toxicity.

The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities showed a significant correlation with honey color, melanoidins, and phenolic and flavonoids contents. Furthermore, the possible effect of honey physicochemical parameters on the gained antimicrobial activities was assessed using the principal component analysis (PCA). Some parameters showed a promising effect and seem to be important in the process of honey samples selection. Namely, melanoidins content, phenolic content, electrical conductivity, and mineral content were shown to be positively influencing the gained antibacterial activity after the combination with essential oil against the tested strains, although a significant negative correlation was seen with the FIC only in the case of Escherichia coli (ATB: 57).",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,HINDAWI LTD,,ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI,"[Imtara, Hamada; Elamine, Youssef; Lyoussi, Badiaa] Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah, Fac Sci Dhar El Mehraz, Lab Physiol Pharmacol & Environm Hlth, BP 1796 Atlas, Fes 30000, Morocco",Origanum vulgare,,Lamiaceae,,"phenolics, noise, flavonoids","phenolics, noise, flavonoids",Escherichia coli,negative,,Origanum vulgare,Lamiaceae,Origanum,Morocco

This highlights the need to search for new antimicrobial agents. Natural fruit by-products are a rich source of bioactive compounds. Pomegranate (Punica granatum) fruit is particularly rich in phenolic bioactive phytochemicals. These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Furthermore, they exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects. Bioactive phytochemicals are found mainly in peel (exocarp and mesocarp), which constitutes about 50% of the whole fresh fruit. This study utilized pomegranate of Jordanian origin to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different Pomegranate peel extracts (PPEs) alone and/or in combination with antibacterial agents against four bacterial strains. Different solvents and extraction methods were employed to obtain the PPEs. A key focus was to explore the enhancement of antibacterial activity against gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) when microwaved aqueous extracts are combined with gentamicin. The antibacterial activity of PPEs varied depending on the extraction method and the solvent used. Notably, the aqueous macerate and microwave-assisted extract showed high potency and similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and P. aeruginosa (MICs 12.5, 25, and 25 mu g/mu L, respectively for both aqueous extracts). In contrast, Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) was more susceptible to the inhibitory activity of organic PPEs with a MIC of 25 mu g/mu L recorded with the use of ethanolic solvents. Bacterial antagonistic activity was observed against gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa, particularly when lower concentrations (3.125, 1.562, 0.781, and 0.39 mu g/mu L) of microwaved aqueous PPEs were evaluated in combination with different concentrations of gentamicin. In conclusion, pomegranate peels, a natural and safe by-product, demonstrate promising antimicrobial potential.

Delile (Balanitaceae) is widely used in the Togolese folk medicine for the treatment of wounds, malaria and skin diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties and the activity of the bark extract of this plant against some resistant bacteria isolated from wounds. Materials and methods: The antimicrobial activity was assayed using the NCCLS microdilution while the DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were used for the antioxidant activity. The susceptibility to conventional antibiotics of bacteria was assessed by an agar disk diffusion method using commercial disk. Phenolics were quantified using spectrophotometric methods. Results: The hydroethanolic extracts of the bark inhibited in vitro the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a dose-dependent manner. Bacteriostatic effects were observed on 15 (33%) and 21 (47%) strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. The MICs and MBCs against Staphylococcus aureus strains ranged respectively from 2.5 to 12.5 mu g/mL and 2.5 to 50 mu g/mL. Concerning Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these values were equal (12.5 mu g/mL). Multidrug resistance was 95% against six antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 91% against five antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus. The DPPH radical scavenging and the FRAP assays yielded weak antioxidant activity, closely linked with the total phenolic contents. Conclusion: This study indicated that the bark extract of Balanites aegyptiaca possess bioactive compounds implicated in the free radical scavenging and antibacterial activities, justifying the use of the plant in the traditional medicines.

The major phenolic composition (tannins, flavonoids, flavonols, ortho-diphenols, total phenolic content), antioxidant (ABTS and DPPH) and reducing capacities (FRAP and total reducing capacity), antimicrobial effects and inhibition of alpha-amylase/alpha-glucosidase were measured. Phenolic compounds were also determined by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Aqueous extracts did not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans between 7.81 and 1000 mg L-1. Rooibos extracted at 85 degrees C for 10 min showed a beneficial interaction with the human erythrocytes, reducing the hemolysis. The correlation analysis showed that the phenolic compounds responsible for the inhibition of alpha-amylase (IC50) were isohrmanetin, isoquercitrin, luteolin, salicylic acid, and syringaldehyde, whereas the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase was correlated to syringaldehyde, isoquercitrin, and luteolin. Overall, rooibos extracted at 85 degrees C had the highest antioxidant activity measured by all assays, higher contents of phenolic compounds (spectrophotometric and LC-ESI-MS/MS data), and lower IC50 values for the digestive enzymes. On the other hand, rooibos extracted at 65 degrees C had the opposite behavior, while rooibos extracted at 75 degrees C presented mean intermediate values for the responses. This result clearly indicates that the extraction temperature is the main factor leading to a higher extraction of bioactive compounds from red rooibos. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the effects of an ethanolic extract of BP leaves (BPE, 200 mg/kg) on mitigating 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation in mice were evaluated. BPE is rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, and polysaccharides, and displays potent antioxidant and antibacterial activities against pathogenic strains such as Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica in vitro. In a mouse study, oral administration of DSS resulted in weight loss, incidence of diarrhea, enlargement of the liver and spleen, impaired colonic morphology, downregulation of both gene and protein expression related to intestinal antioxidant (Nrf2) and barrier function (ZO-1), decreased diversity of colonic microbiota, and 218 differentially altered colonic metabolites; however, co-treatment with BPE did not restore these modified aspects except for the liver index and colonic bacterial diversity.

Furthermore, owing to the limitations of current medical approaches, investigators have begun looking into generating fresh formulations that have enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial capabilities. These activities of combination generated from the fruit and seed of medicinal plants were collected in this investigation from different geographical areas for determining antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. One of the medicinal plants, i.e., Zanthoxylum armatum, belongs to the family Rutaceae and has medicinal values as mentioned in the literature. The objective of our study is to analyse the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of formulations (fruits and seeds with different proportions) from district Bageshwar (location Shama Dura) against specific pathogens. In order to achieve the objective, fruits and seeds of Zanthoxylum armatum were examined through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and estimated in vitro for their synergistic antibacterial potential against three pathogenic microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus using disc-diffusion assays. In addition, antioxidant activity was also performed using 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and estimating its phenolic and total flavonoid content. The results of these studies showed that the maximum zone of inhibition was observed in formulation (40:60; 9-11 mm), whereas the least was observed in formulation (20:80; 3-4 mm) against different bacterial strains. In addition, the formulated samples of fruit and seed combinations may have shown higher antioxidant activity (86.37%), total phenolic (416.2 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid (166.4 mg rutin/g) content. In contrast, FTIR was used to detect the presence of functional groups in the formulated fruit and seed of Zanthoxylum armatum.

(Black turmeric) is a perennial medicinal herb belonging to the Zingiberaceae family that is endangered in Southeast Asia. It is treasured for its high-quality essential oil with tremendous medicinal and aromatic properties. In the present scenario, C. caesia Roxb. is an unexplored plant for drug discovery. Objectives The present study was undertaken to compare the bioactivities of Thirty C. caesia rhizomes and leaf oils collected from various eco-regions of Eastern India. Materials and Methods The comparative antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of leaf and rhizome essential oils from different eco-regions of Eastern India were assessed. The antioxidant activities were evaluated against standards like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. Moreover, the essential oils were also evaluated for their antimicrobial activity using the broth micro-dilution assay for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against multidrug resistant strains. Results Leaf essential oils exhibited a considerable level of antioxidant potential as compared to rhizome essential oils and standard BHT. Furthermore, the essential oils also possessed a significant level of inhibitory activity against three multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The Astragalus genus is found in temperate and dry climates; thus, it is found in Egypt and the arab world. Astragalus caprinus has a good amount of bioactive chemicals, which may help explain its therapeutic effects in reducing the risk of consequences from disease. Method The phytochemical investigation of the herb and roots of Astragalus caprinus L. included the analytical characterization for the petroleum ether components by GC/MS, unsaponifiable matter (unsap. fraction), and fatty acids (FAME) investigation by GLC analysis. Main flavonoids were chromatographically isolated from ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts. In vitro antimicrobial activity has been tested against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans for different plant extracts, the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia, the fungus Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger, and the Escherichia coli bacterium. Metabolite cytotoxicity was examined using the MTT assay against HepG-2 (human liver carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast carcinoma). Results Identifying the important components of the herb and root petroleum ether extracts was achieved. Using column chromatography, luteolin, cosmosiin (apigenin-7-O-glucoside), and cynaroside (luteolin-7-O-glucoside) were separated and identified using UV, NMR, and Mass Spectroscopy. Root extracts displayed potential antimicrobial activity against most of the tested pathogens.

The current study investigated the total phenolic content (TPC), pigment content, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antimutagenic activities in aerial parts of E. spectabilis Bieb. The samples were collected from Bingol, Kahramanmaras (the cities of Turkey) and Nakhcevan. The results showed that TPC of methanolic extracts of E. spectabilis ranged between 60.3 and 115.8 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100g of dry weight (DW). The results of antioxidant activity correlated with TPC, both of which were determined to be highest in the sample collected from Bingol. The sample collected from Kahramanmaras recorded the lowest values for 2,2-dipheny1-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (17.21%), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (42.81%), and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) (263.1 mmol Fe(II)/g DW). It was observed that the pigment content was too high in samples collected from Nakhcevan as compared with others. The strongest antibacterial activity was detected in the sample obtained from Nakhcevan against Enterobacter aerogenes with an inhibition zone of 14.970 mm. Additionally, antifungal activity was recorded only against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four different concentrations (10, 20, 40, and 80 mu l/plate) of E. spectabilis extracts were used to analyze the antimutagenic activity. The tests were designed in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strains.

Traditional healers of Lome harvest only budding leaves early in the morning, in specific area in order to prepare their drugs. Aim of the study: The main goal was to validate the ancestral picking practices, and to assess the activity of C. adansonii medicine towards infectious abscesses. Materials and methods: A phytochemical screening of various C. adansonii leaf samples was performed using an original HPTLC-densitometry protocol and major flavonoids were identified and quantified. C. adansonii samples were collected in different neighborhoods of Lome, at different harvesting-times and at different ages. Radical scavenging capacity, using DPPH assay, was used to quickly screen all extracts. Extracts were tested for anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity and anti-inflammatory effect on human primary keratinocytes infected by S. aureus. IL6, IL8 and TNF alpha expression and production were assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Results: Using antioxidant activity as selection criteria, optimal extracts were obtained with budding leaves, collected at 5:00 am in Djidjole neighborhood. This extract showed the strongest anti-inflammatory effect on S. aureus-infected keratinocytes by reducing IL6, IL8 and TNFa expression and production. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of S. aureus. Conclusions: Those results validate the traditional practices and the potential of C. adansonii as anti-inflammatory drug.

Bacterial biofilms tend to exhibit significant tolerance to antimicrobials drugs during infections. Methods: The antibacterial activity of Thymoquinone (TQ) and its biofilm inhibition potencies were investigated on 11 human pathogenic bacteria. The growth and development of the biofilm were assessed using the crystal violet (CV) and the 2, 3-bis [2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) reduction assay. Results: TQ exhibited a significant bactericidal activity against the majority of the tested bacteria (MICs values ranged from 8 to 32 mu g/ml) especially Gram positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 106510). Crystal violet assay demonstrated that the minimum biofilm inhibition concentration (BIC50) was reached with 22 and 60 mu g/ml for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 106510 respectively. In addition our data revealed that cells oxidative activity was influenced by TQ supplementation. In the same way, TQ prevented cell adhesion to glass slides surface.

Furthermore, the obtained results for a-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 values 44.52 and 80.72 mu g/mL, for the aqueous and ethanol extracts, respectively) indicate significantly higher activity than the positive control, Glucobay (R) (233.38 mu g/mL). The ethanol extract was more effective against all of the examined bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae) than the aqueous extract. On the contrary, the aqueous extract showed better antifungal properties, particularly against Trihoderma viride and Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium.

The objective of this work is to investigate the phytochemistry of the fruit juice of M. citrifolia on one hand and on other hand to evaluate its antiradical and antibacterial activity. The phytochemical investigation was carried out by tube staining tests of the extract of two types of fruit juice of M. citrifolia. The antioxidant activity of these juices was evaluated by reducing the DPPH radical method. Concerning the antibacterial activity, it was tested on the in vitro growth of 10 reference bacterial strains using the well diffusion method. Qualitative phytochemistry of M. citrifolia fruit juices revealed the presence of large groups of secondary metabolites including polyphenols, reducing compounds, mucilage and terpernoids. The antioxidant activity of M. citrifolia fruit juices is dose-dependent and higher than that of ascorbic acid. Antimicrobial activity on other hand revealed that fruit juices inhibit growth inhibitory activity of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, S. epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. This observed difference is significant for each juices on the strains (p < 0.001). These results support the use of M. citrifolia in traditional medicine and are the starting points for the development of a new drug to combat both dietary conditions and chronic conditions associated with oxidative stress.

Background: Wound healing is often delayed due to the presence of polymicrobial load, that have to be abolished to facilitate the healing process. A major class of antimicrobial phytocompound reported to occur in Vernonia arborea species include sesquiterpenes. Reports on the wound healing potency of V. arborea in wound models of Wistar rats however did not report antimicrobial activity of the aqueous or methanolic extracts. Methodology: The column fractions of the hexane leaf extract were tested against the selected strains by agar well diffusion assay and the zone of inhibition confirmed with TLC bioautography at specific Rf. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bioactive fractions was identified using resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined. HPTLC quantification was also performed. Results: Out of the 30 pooled fractions, six showed antimicrobial potency against all the five tested wound microbes. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of these fractions were determined,ranging from 15.62 mu g/mL to 500 mu g/mL for the different microbes. Quantitative High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) revealed two compounds (a and b) in the bioactive fraction10 with yields of 633 mg (63%) and 97 mg (9.7%) per gram of the extract.

The goal of this study was to test different extracts of clove in terms of their phenolic contents, their antioxidant potential and their antibacterial action against pathogenic bacteria. Methods: Ethyl acetate, ethanol (80%) and water were used to extract bioactive phytochemicals from clove. Recovered extracts were studied in terms of total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, antioxidant properties and antibacterial activity. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy was applied to study the effect of ethanol extracts on the morphology and membranes of tested bacterial cells. Results: Ethanol and water were the best solvents for extracting phenolics (ca. 230 mg GAE g(1) extract) but water was the best solvent for extracting flavonoids (17.5 mg QE g (1) extract). Antioxidant potential of clove extracts was estimated using DPPH center dot (1,1-diphenyl-2 picrylhydrazyl), ABTS(center dot) + 2, 2'azino bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline- 6-sulfonic acid), beta-carotene-linoleic bleaching assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Ethanol and water extracts showed comparable antioxidant activity to the synthetic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). The DPPH center dot radical quenching activity varied from 25.3 to 91.4%, while clove extracts showed ABTS(center dot)+ scavenging activities from 49.4 to 99.4%. Clove extracts inhibited the bleaching of beta-carotene wherein the order of decreasing activity was water > ethanol > ethyl acetate extracts as compared with TBHQ. Extracts showed strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739. Clove extracts exhibited antibacterial activities against the growth of S. aureus and E. coli in concentration range from 50 to 100 mu g/mL. The results indicated that the extracts with stronger antibacterial capacity also had higher phenolic content. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that ethanol extract damaged the morphology and membranes of tested bacterial cells. Conclusions: Using cloves and their extracts in food or pharmaceutical products may be an effective antioxidant and antimicrobial control strategy. Data from this study might be used for developing natural preservatives and bioactive agents with health promoting activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The bark of R. verniciflua has been used as an immunostimulator in traditional medicine, but also causes allergic dermatitis due to urushiol derivatives. For the development of active natural resources with less toxicity, the antibacterial activity of various parts of R. verniciflua such as bark, lignum, leaves and fruit, together with chemical composition, were investigated. Among the various parts of R. verniciflua, lignum showed the most potent antibacterial activity against fish pathogenic bacteria such as Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum and Streptococcus iniae. Measurement of total phenolic content and flavonoid content clearly showed a high content of phenolic and flavonoids in lignum among the various parts of R. verniciflua. Further analysis showed a close correlation between antibacterial activity and phenolic content. In addition, methyl gallate and fustin, the major constituents of bark and lignum, showed antibacterial activity, which suggested phenolic constituents as active constituents. The content of urushiols, however, was highest in bark, but there was a trace amount in lignum. LC-MS-MS and PCA analysis showed good discrimination with the difference of phenolic composition in various parts of R. verniciflua. Taken together, phenolic compounds are responsible for the antibacterial activity of R. verniciflua. The lignum of R. verniciflua contains high content of phenolic compounds with less urushiols, which suggests efficient antibacterial activity with less toxicity.

They are often composted after the fruits are harvested, reducing the cause of environmental pollutions due to open burning. Objectives: The study aims to identify the bioactive compounds in banana [Musa acuminate x una Colla cv. Saba (Musaceae)] inflorescence buds that are responsible for the antibacterial activity on selected foodborne pathogens. Methods: Dried inflorescence buds were extracted using methanol and subsequently partitioned into chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and deionized water. Further isolation of bioactive components was based on a bioassay-guided fractionation and the inhibitory activity at various concentrations against selected foodbome pathogens was determined. The compounds were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: The SPE-fraction 3 (BWF-3) purified from the methanolic water partition of banana inflorescence showed the most prominent inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration at 12.0 mu g/ml. The BWF-3 was later identified as proanthocyanidins with epigallocatechin as the main extension unit. Additionally, the survival of Listeria monocytogenes increased with the fortification of ferum (II) and (III) at a concentration as low as 1 mM but not for the calcium, magnesium, manganese and glucose.

The aim of our study is to detect microbiological contamination and to assess the antimicrobial, antioxidant activity, total phenolic, carotenoid content, genome size, and ploidy of non-cultivated Rosa canina sampled from urban areas. Samples of Rosa canina fruits were collected in three locations in Slovakia. The highest total viable count and the Enterobacteriaceae count in fruits were 4.32 log CFU/g and 4.29 log CFU/g, respectively. Counts of the mesophilic anaerobic sporulating bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., and of the microscopic fungi and yeasts were 3.00, 2.15 log CFU/g, 3.65 log CFU/g, and 2.76 log CFU/g, respectively. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, Escherichia coli and Klebsiela oxytoca were the most sensitive species among the assayed microorganisms to the treatment with the ethanolic extracts of Rosa canina fruits. The fruits were rich in bioactive compounds, polyphenols, and carotenoids, that could be related to their antioxidant activity. Genome sizes of analyzed samples ranged from 2.3 to 2.96.

The isomeric mixture of pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins (beta-aescin) exert anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, research has focused on beta-aescin, yet the diversity, accumulation, and bioactivity of organ-specific secondary metabolites represent missed pharmacological opportunities. To this end, we applied an untargeted metabolomics approach by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to the chemical profiles of flowers, immature fruits, and pedicels from 40 specimens across 18 species of Aesculus. Principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS-DA), and molecular networking revealed stronger chemical differences between plant organs, than between species. Flowers are rich in glycosylated flavonoids, pedicels in organic acids and flavonoid aglycones, and immature fruits in monomeric flavan-3-ols and procyanidins. Although a high diversity of flavonoids and procyanidins was observed, the relative amounts differed by plant organ. Fruit extracts demonstrated the strongest antifungal (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and antioxidant activity, likely from the procyanidins. Overall, secondary metabolite profiles are organ-specific, and fruits accumulate antifungal and antioxidant compounds. Due to the chemical similarity between species, similar effects may be achieved between species.

It is urgent to find new antimicrobial agents against streptococcosis. In this study, 20 medicinal plants were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to obtain medicinal plants and potential bioactive compounds against GBS infection. The results showed that the ethanol extracts of 20 medicinal plants had low or no antibacterial properties in vitro, with a minimal inhibitory concentration >= 256 mg/L. Interestingly, in vivo tests showed that 7 medicinal plants could significantly inhibit GBS infection in tilapia, and Sophora flavescens (SF) had the strongest anti-GBS activity in tilapia, reaching 92.68%. SF could significantly reduce the bacterial loads of GBS in different tissues (liver, spleen and brain) of tilapia after treated with different tested concentrations (12.5, 25.0, 50.0 and 100.0 mg/kg) for 24 h. Moreover, 50 mg/kg SF could significantly improve the survival rate of GBS-infected tilapia by inhibiting GBS replication. Furthermore, the expression of antioxidant gene cat, immune-related gene c-type lysozyme and anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in liver tissue of GBS-infected tilapia significantly increased after treated with SF for 24 h. Meanwhile, SF significantly reduced the expression of immune-related gene myd88 and pro-inflammatory cytokines il-8 and il-1 beta in liver tissue of GBS-infected tilapia. The negative and positive models of UPLC-QE-MS, respectively, identified 27 and 57 components of SF. The major components of SF extract in the negative model were alpha, alpha-trehalose, DL-malic acid, D-(-)-fructose and xanthohumol, while in the positive model were oxymatrine, formononetin, (-)-maackiain and xanthohumol.

In this study the essential oil obtained from A. sphaerocephalon subsp. sphaerocephalon inflorescences was analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and also evaluated for in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The obtained results are reported for the first time and discussed with respect to the sulfur compounds detected in the essential oil. RESULTS: Ninty-one compounds were identified, representing 91.6% (w/w) of the total oil. Major constituents of the analysed sample were shyobunol (15.3%), beta-caryophyllene (8.1%), alpha-cadinol (7.8%), 3,5-diethyl-1,2,4-trithiolane (isomer II, 5.9%) and delta-cadinene (5.2%). The diluted oil had an antioxidant capacity of 160 000 +/- 111 mu mol alpha-tocopherol acetate equivalents g(-1). Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated against five bacterial and two fungal strains using the broth microdilution assay. Among the micro-organisms tested, the most susceptible strains were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentration = 0.08/2.5 mg mL(-1)) and Aspergillus niger (minimal inhibitory/fungicidal concentration = 0.31/0.63 mg mL(-1)). CONCLUSION: The results showed that the examined species had strong antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and are in accordance with the popular use of plants belonging to the genus Allium in traditional medicine, emphasising the necessity of further detailed study of the active principles in Allium species.

The C. rotundus essential oil comprised 49 identified compounds, including longiverbenone, cyperotundone, (-)-eudesma-1,4(15),11-triene (eudesmatriene), beta-copaen-4a-ol, humulene epoxide 2 and a-copaene as the most abundant. The essential oil weakly scavenged 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) free radicals, and was active against all tested microorganisms with an inhibition concentration ranging from 1.53 to 49 mg/mL. In silico molecular docking revealed that the major compounds involved hydrophobic interactions to bind efficiently with NorA, AcrB and Cdr1p drugs efflux transporters as candidate targets to combat drugs resistance, in addition to have a remarkable competitivity with standard inhibitors chlorpromazine and fluconazole. The C. rotundus essential oil marked an interesting antimicrobial activity, even more on gram-negative E. coli.

Seeds on the growth kinetics of micro-organisms isolated from the buccal cavities of periodontal patients,"An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil (EO) and methanol extract (ME) from Algerian Nigella sativa L. seeds against microbial strains isolated from the oral cavities of periodontal patients was performed. Twelve Gram-positive bacteria, eleven Gramnegative bacteria and three microscopic fungi strains were isolated and identified. The antimicrobial activities of EO and ME were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus, Porphyromonas sp., Veillonella sp., Candida sp. and Saccharomyces sp.. The total polyphenol and flavonoids contents of ME were higher than those of EO. Thin layer chromatography showed that catechin, gallic acid and quercetin were most likely present in the extracts. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis (FT-IR) indicated the presence of bands from the CO groups of acids, alcohols, phenols, and ethers and the C=O band of aldehydes. Analysis of the antimicrobial activity of N. sativa extracts obtained by the microdilution method showed excellent bactericidal activity of the essential oil and moderate efficiency of the ME against all the microbes tested. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Porphyromonas sp. were the most sensitive to EO (minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC): 16,500 mu g/ml) at 48 h of incubation and, 125,000 mu g/ml of ME was the most active against all the microbes tested. However, after 18 or 24 h, this efficiency was decreased in some strains. In addition, Saccharomyces sp. and Candida albicans were more sensitive to EO than ME during the incubation, while this efficiency was clearly not visible with the agar well method, and most microbes tested presented remarkable resistance to these extracts.

Recent overexploitation to meet the increasing demand of dragon's blood has resulted in the rapid depletion of the natural resource. D. cambodiana grows very slow, but has plenty of leaves that regenerate yearly. This work aimed to use the leaf to produce dragon's blood, by fungal elicitation, and to study the physical and chemical profiles as well as biological activities of the elicited product. Both Fusarium proliferatum YM-266 and F. proliferatum YM-71213 effectively elicited dragon's blood formation from the leaves in and around the inoculation spots. The dragon's blood produced from the leaves by the fungal elicitation was similar in physical property, chemical property (analyzed by TLC and HPLC), as well as in anticoagulant activity, but was higher in total flavonoid content and antimicrobial activity than that from the stem. These findings provide a possibility to sustainably produce dragon's blood from the regeneratable leaves without destroying the tree and environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Chinese wild blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) crude extract (BBE) was obtained using methanol extraction, and sugars plus organic acids (F1), phenolics fraction (F2), and anthocyanins plus proanthocyanidins (F3) fractions were separated using C-18 Sep-Pak columns. The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of each fractional component were determined using a two-fold-serial dilution method. Nucleic acid leakage (OD260 nm) and protein release (Bradford protein assay) were determined by spectrophotometry, to evaluate the permeability of the cell membrane. F3 was found to exhibit the greatest antimicrobial activity against the four tested strains, followed by F2, F1, and BBE. V. parahaemolyticus was the most sensitive to the all fractions, followed by S. Enteritidis, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus. Survival curve analysis showed that the number of bacteria decreased from six log colony-forming units (CFU) to less than 10 CFU after bacteria were treated with fractions for 12 hr, which demonstrated the bactericidal effect of blueberry fractions. Furthermore, when the pathogens were treated with fractions for 2 hr, the OD260 nm and OD595 nm values increased significantly (P < 0.01), which indicated the significant release of nucleic acid and protein. The results from this study indicated that blueberry fractions, especially F3, inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens by damaging their cell membrane, and may be developed as a natural preservative to prevent and control foodborne pathogens.

The type of manna being investigated in the present study is called Gaz-alafi, a mixture of insect and Quercus brantii leaves secretions from oak forests in the north of Iraq and west of Iran. MethodsAqueous and ethanol extracts were prepared as decoction. Various phytochemical tests were conducted to analyze manna composition, including total phenolic contents using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and LC-MS. Gallic acid and catechin were detected in both extracts, in addition to tiliroside presence in ethanol extract, which added more value to the phenolic content of ethanol extract. Cytotoxic activities of Gaz alafi were evaluated against breast cancer cell lines and compared to normal cell lines and doxorubicin using the MTT assay. Antimicrobial properties were assessed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans using the dilution method of the micro-titer plate. Serum levels of IFN-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using ELISA. The effect of extracts on splenocyte proliferation was evaluated using the lymphocytes proliferation assay. Macrophage function was evaluated using the nitro blue tetrazolium assay, whereas pinocytosis was evaluated using the neutral red uptake assay. Ten days after tumor inoculation, changes in tumor size, survival rates, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine were measured. ResultsThe growth of cancer cells was inhibited by Gaz alafi ethanol extract. An alteration in IFN- gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 levels toward antiproliferation immune response were reported for both extracts. The aqueous extract efficiently stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis, and pinocytosis, followed by the ethanol extracts with moderate activity.

Antioxidant activities were assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH & BULL;) scavenging activity, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The antimicrobial activity was determined using the microdilution method against some Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to evaluate the phenolic profile of extracts. Flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids were detected. (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin turned out to be the most abundant in the phenolic profile of V. amurensis seed extract. Phenolic acids prevailed in the extract from V. vinifera seeds. The V. riparia and V. californica seed extracts had higher contents of most individual phenolics compared to the other Vitis species. They also showed a higher total phenolic content, DPPH & BULL; scavenging activity, ORAC, and overall antibacterial activity. Total phenolic content significantly correlated with antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity against E. coli. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed discrimination between V. vinifera, V. amurensis, and clustered V. riparia and V. californica with respect to variables. To recapitulate, this research demonstrates that seeds of different Vitis species, especially V. riparia and V. californica, are sources of molecules with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities that can be used in different sectors, such as in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.",MOLECULES,MDPI,grape seeds; by-products; phytochemical profile; Gram-negative bacteria; Gram-positive bacteria; antiradical activity,GRAPE POMACE; IN-VITRO; VINIFERA; FOOD; IDENTIFICATION; OXIDATION; SKINS,"[Pozzo, Luisa; Grande, Teresa; Raffaelli, Andrea; Longo, Vincenzo] Inst Agr Biol, Biotechnol Natl Res Council IBBA CNR, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Grande, Teresa] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Biomed Sci Mario Serio, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Raffaelli, Andrea] Crop Sci Res Ctr, St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Weidner, Stanislaw] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Biol & Biotechnol, Dept Biochem, Oczapowskiego 1A, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Amarowicz, Ryszard; Karamac, Magdalena] Inst Anim Reprod & Food Res, Polish Acad Sci, Tuwima 10, PL-10748 Olsztyn, Poland",V,"Vitis amurensis, Vitis riparia, Vitis californica, Vitis vinifera",,"Vitaceae, Vitaceae, Vitaceae, Vitaceae","phenolics, flavonoids, flavonoids, isolated compounds, isolated compounds, phenolics, stilbenoids, noise","phenolics, flavonoids, flavonoids, isolated compounds, isolated compounds, phenolics, stilbenoids, noise","Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis","negative, positive, negative, positive",,"Vitis amurensis, Vitis riparia, Vitis californica, Vitis vinifera","Vitaceae, Vitaceae, Vitaceae, Vitaceae","Vitis, Vitis, Vitis, Vitis",Italy

The purpose of this study was to explore the inhibitory and the bactericidal activities of Punica granatum against Salmonella strains. The effect of extracts obtained from different parts (peels, seeds, juice and flowers) of pomegranate and using different solvents against Salmonella enterica serovars Kentucky and Enteritidis isolated from chicken meat was thus investigated. Salmonella strains were identified with the standard API-20E system and confirmed by real time PCR. The obtained results showed that the highest antibacterial activity against Salmonella strains was observed with the peels ethanolic extract giving MIC values ranging from 10.75 to 12.5 mg/mL. The ethanolic extract of P. granatum Nana peels at 0.8 and 1.6 mg/g significantly inhibited the growth of Salmonella Kentucky in chicken meat stored at 4 degrees C. The phenolic composition of the ethanolic peel extract was explored by HPLC coupled to both DAD and ESI/TOF-MS detections. The obtained results allowed the detection of 21 phytochemical compounds among which various phenolic compounds have been identified on the basis of their UV and MS spectra as well as with literature data. Among the detected compounds, anthocyanins, ellagitannins, ellagic add derivatives and flavanols were further characterized through MS-MS analysis. Our results showed thus that the Tunisian variety Nana pomegranate constitutes a good source of bioactive compounds with potent antimicrobial activity on the growth of Salmonella strains suggesting that the studied pomegranate cultivar could be a natural remedy to minimize the emergence of Salmonella enterica strains which is often involved in food borne illness.

Anticancer activity was performed using potato-disc assay and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. While antibacterial and antifungal evaluation was done by using disc diffusion method against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia) and fungal (Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium oxysporum) strains. Among different extraction solvents used, n-hexane extract exhibited the highest inhibition of tumour initiation (64%), whereas ethyl acetate (15%) was the lowest by using potato-disc assay. Highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were noted for methanolic (69.10 GAE mg/g DW%) and n-hexane (29.45 CE mg/g DW%) extracts, respectively. For antioxidant potential, 2,2,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging (IC50) and reducing power EC50 were noted to be superior (0.6 and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively) for n-hexane extract. All the tested extracts showed considerable antibacterial and antifungal activity with the highest growth inhibition zones for K. pneumoniae (31.70 mm) and A. flavus (27.09 mm) were shown by n-hexane extract. High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of individual phenolics (gallic acid, 2,288.48 mg/kg) indicated the highest contents of these compounds in n-hexane extract, which might explain the potent biological activities of this extract. Our findings revealed that the bioactive present in the tested fruit had significant potential as anticancer, antibacterial, and antifungal agents.

Non-anthocyanin polyphenol profiles, antibacterial, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, anti-inflammatory activities, and structures of extracts are evaluated. Results show no significant differences in the extraction of total flavonoid content (15.85-16.63 mg QEs/g) and ACE inhibitory activity (51.30-52.86%) between RF-E and EA extracts. RF-E extract shows the highest anti-inflammatory activities. FTIR and UV spectra reveal that acidified EtOH treatment has a significant effect on the structure of the extract due to its highest flavonoid content (20.33 mg QEs/g), thus it has the highest antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Sixteen non-anthocyanin polyphenols are identified by UPLC-PDA-TOF-ESI-MS and RF pre-treatment did not cause significant compound degradation. The chemometric analysis shows that enzymatic hydrolysis significantly increased biological activities, and the presence of non-anthocyanin polyphenols correlates well with ACE inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities.

Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata are two phytopathogenic fungi that attack tomato in the field and postharvest. To control them, synthetic chemical fungicides are used; however, the fungi develop resistance to them, and they can cause damage to human health and the environment. Therefore, research on plant polyphenolic extracts with fungicidal potential has increased. Flourensia microphylla has shown antifungal activity in vitro against different phytopathogens; however, the extraction process is a main factor affecting this activity. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has been reported to increase the bioactivity of plant extracts. Based on the above, the aims of the present study were to evaluate how F. microphylla extract affects polyphenolic composition, antioxidant capacity, and antifungal activity. A total of 9 F. microphylla extracts were obtained by UAE, and a control extract was obtained by conventional extraction. The yield, total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC, respectively), antioxidant activities by three methods, and polyphenol identification by high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) of the extracts were evaluated. The antifungal activity of the extract was evaluated in vitro against F. oxysporum and A. alternata, for which an extract treatment was selected considering the treatment that obtained the highest TFC and antioxidant activity values as a criterion. As a result, three phenolic acids and six flavonoids were detected in the extract treatments: gallic, 4-hydroxybenzoic and ferulic acids, catechin, naringin, quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamentin and chrysin. In addition to reducing the extraction times, the treatment that was selected corresponded to a solvent-to-sample ratio of 40 mL/g and an extraction time of 20 min. The selected extract resulted in an extraction yield of 23.4 g/100 g dry weight (DW), TPC of 252.8 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g DW, and TFC of 435.9 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g DW. For antioxidant activities, the 2,2-diphenyl 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and reducing power values were 74.2, 740.4 mM Trolox/g DW and 33.0 mg ascorbic acid/g DW, respectively. Moreover, the F. microphylla treatment selected inhibited 87.72 % of the mycelial growth of F. oxysporum and 100 % of that of A. alternata, demonstrating fungistatic and fungicidal activity, respectively, in the fungi under study. Thus, the phenolic extract obtained by UAE increased the contents of phenolic compounds, mainly flavonoids, as well as antioxidants, which potentiated the bioactivity of F. microphylla against phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, the antifungal activity could be attributed to the presence of flavonoid compounds identified in the selected polyphenolic extract.",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,ELSEVIER,Flourensia microphylla; Ultrasound-assisted extraction; Polyphenolic compounds; Antifungal activity; Fusarium oxysporum; Alternaria alternata,ULTRASOUND-ASSISTED EXTRACTION; ACTIVITY IN-VITRO; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; TROPICAL FRUITS; L.; PLANTS; ACID; KAEMPFEROL; QUERCETIN,"[Carrillo-Lomeli, Dennise A.; de Rodriguez, Diana Jasso; Rodriguez-Garcia, Raill; Gonzalez-Morales, Susana; Villarreal-Quintanilla, Jose A.] Univ Autonoma Agr Antonio Narro, Saltillo 25315, Coahuila, Mexico; [Moo-Huchin, Victor M.] Tecnol Nacl Mexico, Inst Tecnol Merida, Merida 97118, Yucatan, Mexico; [Ramon-Canul, Lorena] Univ Sierra Sur, Oaxaca 70800, Mexico",Flourensia microphylla,,Asteraceae,,"phenolics, phenolics, isolated compounds, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids","phenolics, phenolics, isolated compounds, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids",,,"Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata",Flourensia microphylla,Asteraceae,Flourensia,Mexico

Based on report, it is the predominant bioactive compound from the rhizomes of Zingiber zerumbet. The study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effects of topical zerumbone on excision wounds in rats. A 1% (w/w) simple ointment containing zerumbone was applied topically (100 mg ointment per rat) once a day on full-thickness excision wounds created on rats. The wound tissue was removed and used for estimation of antioxidant activity and to observe histopathological changes. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to study the expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and collagen IV. Zerumbone exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Candida tropicali. Zerumbone ointment has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction on 15th post wounding day. The histopathological examinations of healed wound sections showed greater tissue regeneration, more fibroblasts and angiogenesis in zerumbone ointment-treated group. VEGF, TGF-beta 1 and collagen IV expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Zerumbone possesses potent antioxidant activity by increasing superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and decreased lipid peroxidation. The synergistic effects of both antimicrobial and antioxidant activities in zerumbone are deduced to have accelerated the wound repair. The results demonstrate that zerumbone possessed strong wound healing potential and can be exploited to accelerate excision wound healing. (C) 2017 Tissue Viability Society.

In recent years, several reports and scientific articles claim the contamination of honey by antibiotics, detectable concentrations of antibiotic residues in honey are illegal. They, may cause hypersensitivity or resistance to drug therapy in humans, and are perceived by consumers as undesirable. In this sense, the purpose of this work was to examine the antibacterial activity of the Euphorbia resinifera (E. resinifera) honey against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro using the well-agar diffusion assay followed by dilution range to obtain more precise minimum inhibitory concentration values. The second aim is to evaluate the presence of antibiotics in honey using a screening test: Evidence Investigator (TM), an immuno-enzymatic method for detection of 27 antibiotic residues followed by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for confirmation of suspect samples; in order to assess the relationship between the presence of antibiotic residues and the antibacterial activity of honey. In this study, a total of 37 E. resinifera honey samples were analyzed. The results show that all samples of honey inhibited the growth of bacteria at the dilutions at 50% (v/v); the highest inhibition zone (25.98 +/- 0.11 mm) was recorded from sample 5 for Staphylococcus aureus and (13.84 +/- 1.10 mm) in sample 17 for Escherichia coli and that 50% (v/v) dilutions showed significant antibacterial effect compared to other dilutions (6.25, 12.5, 25% (v/v)). In all samples, there were no antibiotic residues detected except for one showing the detection of Trimethoprim at 6.48 mu g kg-1. Our research is one of the first studies that relate the he relationship between the presence of antibiotic residues and the antibacterial activity of Euphorbia resinifera honey and showed that the antibacterial activity of honey might be due to the high osmotic nature, a low pH, its content of phenolic compounds and hydrogen peroxide and also to its content of methylglyoxal.",EMIRATES JOURNAL OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNIV,Euphorbia resinifera honey; antibacterial activity; antibiotic residues; multi-array; screening; LC-MS/MS,BIOCHIP MULTIARRAY TECHNOLOGY; EUROPEAN GUIDELINE; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; SCREENING METHODS; VALIDATION; SULFONAMIDE; EXTRACTS; BACTERIA,"[Benjamaa, Rania; Moujanni, Abdelkarim; Eddoha, Rabiaa; Benbachir, Maryam; Moujahid, Abderrahman; Nasser, Boubker; Zyate, Nadia; Essamadi, Abdel Khalid] Hassan First Univ Settat, Fac Sci & Technol, Lab Biochem Neurosci Nat Resources & Environm, Settat 577, Morocco; [Moujanni, Abdelkarim] Natl Off Food Safety ONSSA, Ave Hadj Ahmed Cherkaoui, Rabat, Morocco; [Terrab, Anass] Univ Seville, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Ap 1095, Seville 41080, Spain; [Darkaoui, Sami; Talmi, Ali] ONSSA, Div Pharm & Vet Inputs, Control & Expertise Dept, Rabat, Morocco",Euphorbia Resinifera,,Euphorbiaceae,,"phenolics, noise","phenolics, noise","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Euphorbia Resinifera,Euphorbiaceae,Euphorbia,Morocco

Moreover, accessible data showed that some Populus bud extracts may be excellent antibacterial agents, especially against Gram-positive bacteria. Due to the fragmentary nature of the data found, we conducted a systematic screening study. The antimicrobial activity of two extract types (semi-polar-ethanolic and polar-ethanolic-water (50/50; V/V)) from 27 bud samples of different poplar taxons were compared. Antimicrobial assays were performed against Gram-positive (five strains) and Gram-negative (six strains) bacteria as well as fungi (three strains) and covered the determination of minimal inhibitory, bactericidal, and fungicidal concentrations. The composition of extracts was later investigated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection (UHPLC-DAD) and with electrospray-quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS). As a result, most of the extracts exhibited good (MIC <= 62.5 mu g/mL) or moderate (62.5 < MIC <= 500 g/mL) activity against Gram-positives and Helicobacter pylori, as well as fungi.

This study aimed to comprehensively identify and analyze the bioactive phytoconstituents within H. heteroclita subsp. indochinensis seeds. Seeds were sequentially extracted with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected ferulic acid, salicylic acid, cucurbitacin E, stigmasterol glucoside, and beta-sitosterol glucoside in all extracts. The total phenolic content in the HH(S)-EtOAc and HH(S)-MeOH was 14.22 +/- 1.58 and 12.98 +/- 1.03 mg gallic acid equivalent/g, respectively. Consequently, the HH(S)-EtOAc demonstrated antioxidant activity with an IC50 of 1.10 +/- 0.28 mg/mL, while the HH(S)-MeOH displayed strong antioxidant potential with an IC50 of 0.04 +/- 0.00 mg/mL according to an ABTS assay. Antibacterial evaluations of both the HH(S)-hexane and HH(S)-EtOAc revealed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition (ZOI): 13.67 +/- 2.31 and 11.67 +/- 1.53 mm, respectively) but limited activity against Escherichia coli (ZOI: 7.33 +/- 0.58 and 7.67 +/- 0.58 mm, respectively). Additionally, the extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values, ranging from 62.50 to 250 mg/mL. The antiproliferative activity of seed extracts was assessed against two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), normal breast cells (MCF10A), and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, through MTT and clonogenic assays.

Knowledge of their chemical composition and biological activities can contribute to the creation of natural-based products usefully employed in human health. In this work, we analysed Paederia grandidieri leaves extracted with diverse eco-compatible procedures and subjected to chemical, microbiological, and cellular compatibility assays. Fresh leaves of P. grandidieri were harvested in southern Madagascar, where most of the population relies on P. grandidieri for daily dental care. Leaves were dried and powdered. Distilled water and ethanol at 25 degrees C and 60 degrees C from 6 to 24 h were used for extraction. Polyphenol composition, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial, prebiotic, and cytotoxic properties of the extracts were analysed. The aqueous extracts contained higher levels of flavan-3-ols and flavanones, while the hydro-alcoholic extracts were richer in flavonols and flavones. The aqueous extracts showed the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity. The hydro-alcoholic extracts showed antibacterial effects against Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two key foodborne and environmental pathogens, while the aqueous extracts showed prebiotic effects against Streptococcus salivarius. The cytotoxic effects of P. grandidieri leaf extracts were evaluated using the MTT assay on mouse fibroblasts (L929 cell line). The most cytotoxic extract was the aqueous extract at 25 degrees C. Given that P. grandidieri is routinely employed by the southern Madagascar population with healthy and strong teeth with fewer cases of tooth decay with respect to other regions, and in light of the significant chemical and microbiological properties, we maintain that P. grandidieri can be a suitable candidate for the production of pro-health products for the oral cavity.

The objective of this research was to research the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of hydroethanolic extracts from the C. humilis plant's leaves and roots. The content of polyphenols and flavonoids was evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteu's and aluminum chloride assays. Two techniques were used to evaluate antioxidant properties: antioxidant capacity in total (TAC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhdrazyl (DPPH). In antimicrobial assays, five pathogenic microbial strains were studied including two Escherichia coli, one coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Candida albicans, by two techniques: agar disk diffusion and microdilution. Leaves had a greater content of flavonoids 27.07 mg QE/g of extract and the polyphenols 38.84 mg GAE/g of extract than root 24.39 mg QE/g of extract and 29.39 mg GAE/g of extract, respectively. The TAC test value of the 0.77 mg AAE/g extract in the leaf extract was found to be significantly greater than that of the 0.60 mg EAA/g extract in the root extract. The DPPH antioxidant assay IC(50 )values of the root and leaf extract were 0.23 and 0.93 mu g/mL, respectively. C. humilis extracts showed an antimicrobial effect against all tested strains, the inhibitory zone (DIZ) have values in the range between 12 and 15 mm. Moreover, the root extract showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus with an IC50 value of 6.25 mg/mL.

The methanol extract of the roots of this plant showed significant activity against one of the clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori which was resistant to metronidazole. The aim of this study was the isolation and evaluation of the major compounds of G. iranicum effective against H. pylori. The compounds were isolated using various chromatographic methods and identified by spectroscopic data (H-1 and C-13 NMR, HMQC, HMBC, EI-MS). An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed employing the disk diffusion method against clinical isolates of H. pylori and a micro dilution method against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; additionally the inhibition zone diameters (IZD) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were recorded. Nine compounds were isolated: two triterpenoids, uvaol and niga-ichigoside F1 three sterols, beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosteryl acetate, and beta-sitosteryl linoleate, one phenyl propanoid, eugenol, one phenolic glycoside, gein, one flavanol, (+)-catechin, and sucrose. The aqueous fraction, obtained by partitioning the MeOH extract with water and chloroform, was the most effective fraction of the extract against all clinical isolates of H. pylori. Further investigation of the isolated compounds showed that eugenol was effective against H. pylori but gein, diglycosidic eugenol, did not exhibit any activity against H. pylori. The subfraction D-4 was the effective fraction which contained tannins. It appeared that tannins were probably the active compounds responsible for the anti-H. pylori activity of G. iranicum. The aqueous fraction showed a moderate inhibitory activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Materials and methods. The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Hippophae rhamnoides L. products - 100% oil, 100% juice, dry berries, and tea (dry berries, leaves, and twigs). The antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH radical scavenging and molybdenum reducing antioxidant power methods. The content of phytochemicals (polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids) was measured by colorimetric methods. The detection of antimicrobial activity was carried out using the disc diffusion method and an evaluation of minimal inhibition concentration against three species of Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli CCM 3988, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica CCM 3807, Yersinia enterocolitica CCM 5671, and three Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus thuringiensis CCM 19, Listeria monocytogenes CCM 4699, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus CCM 2461. Results. All the tested sea buckthorn products had a high antioxidant activity. The highest content of total polyphenols (204.26 mg GAE/g), flavonoids (30.00 mg QE/g), and carotenoids (0.34 mg/g) were identified in 100% sea buckthorn juice. Maximal values of the antioxidant activity were found using the DPPH method for 100% oil (8.75 mg TE/g) and molybdenum reducing power for tea (196.41 mg TE/g). All the tested products showed strong antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria, confirmed by both methods - disc diffusion (especially for Yersinia enterocolitica CCM 5671) and minimal inhibitory concentration.

Pseudoprason) is a wild plant in northwestern Iran. The plant is traditionally used, besides as spice, also for its medicinal properties. Aim of the study: Due to the shortcoming evidence in scientific research and the importance of this plant in folk medicine, this study aims to assess the chemical compositions and biological activities, which have no longer reported to date. Materials and methods: The bulbs of A. hooshidaryae were collected from West Azerbaijan, Iran. The plant essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using Clevenger-type apparatus according to the European pharmacopeia. The plant hydromethanolic extract was obtained using maceration method. The volatile oil compositions of A. hooshidaryae bulbs were evaluated by use of combined gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. Furthermore, different biological activities of the yielded essential oil and hydromethanolic extract were in vitro evaluated. The antibacterial and antifungal activities were assessed using disc diffusion assay, tube dilution assay, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC). The cytotoxic activities were assayed by reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) toward two human cancerous cell lines (MOLT-4 and MCF-7). Antioxidant activity was investigated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH center dot) radical scavenging assay. Results: GC/FID and GC/MS analyses allowed detecting 62 components in the A. hooshidaryae essential oil representing the 91.87% of the total oil. The volatile compounds were identified by comparison of the relative retention indices (RRI), mass spectra with those in NIST08/NIH and Wiley (257 and 7 L) libraries and co-elution with authentic samples where available. Surprisingly, the most abundant compound was obtained as menthol (19.0%) followed by carvacrol (10.1%), menthone (6.4%), methyl (methylthiomethyl) disulfide (4.2%), dimethyl disulfide (3.8%), and thymol (3.8%). Contrary to the other Allium species enriched by sulfur compounds, just three compounds accounting for 10.7% of the total oil were obtained as the sulfur-sulfur bond containing components (Dimethyl disulfide, Methyl (methylthio) methyl disulfide, Bis-methylthiomethyl disulfide). The hydromethanolic extract of A. hooshidaryae showed higher anti-radical (IC50 DPPH of 9.81 mu g/mL) and cytotoxic (for MOLT-4 and MCF-7, IC50s were 76.3 and 128.6 mu g/mL, respectively) activities rather than that of the obtained essential oil (IC50 DPPH of 39.9 mu g/mL; IC50 MOLT-4 of 109.2 mu g/mL, and IC50 MCF-7 of 297.5 mu g/mL). While, the essential oil exhibited the anti-Staphylococcus aurous and anti-Escherichia coli activities approximately the same as Chloramphenicol (positive control). The MIC values were 31.25 and 62.5 mu g/mL and the disk inhibition zone values were 23 and 21 mm, respectively. In addition, Candida albicans had moderate sensitivity (MFC of 62.5 mu g/mL) for the essential oil. Conclusions: The hydromethanolic extract of A. hooshidaryae shows the potency to be used for food protection in addition to further cytotoxic investigations. Associated with antimicrobial abilities of both A. hooshidaryae products, the compatible results was observed with the traditional claim having being not investigated to date.

Its industrial processing produces a substantial amount of waste, particularly peels, which present an appealing potential source of bioactive compounds. This study focuses on optimizing the extraction of phenolics from kiwi peels using a water bath (WB) and infrared irradiation (IR) and assessing their biological activities. (2) Methods: Optimal conditions for polyphenol extraction from kiwifruit peels, in terms of temperature and time, were determined using Response Surface Methodology. Total phenolic content (TPC) was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and antioxidant activity was assessed utilizing the DPPH method. Antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium were determined using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The lyophilized extract was tested for its anticancer effect on A549 lung cancer cell lines. The phytochemical profiles of the WB and IR extracts were analyzed through High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). (3) Results: The optimal extraction conditions for the WB method were found to be 75 degrees C for 35 min, and 90 degrees C for 5 min for IR. The corresponding TPC obtained by IR was 21 mg GAE/g DM, which was 4.4 times higher than that obtained by WB (4.8 mg GAE/g DM). This indicates that IR was more efficient in extracting phenolics from kiwi peels. The antioxidant activity under the optimum conditions of WB and IR was 14 mg TE/g DM and 16 mg TE/g DM, respectively. Both the WB and IR extracts demonstrated antibacterial activity against B. cereus with an MIC value of 25 mg/mL. Additionally, the IR extract displayed an antibacterial effect against S. aureus, with an MIC value of 50 mg/mL. The WB and IR kiwi peel extracts were effective in significantly reducing A549 cell viability at 50 mu g/mL and 100 mu g/mL, respectively. Caffeic acid (0.54 ppm) and catechin (5.44 ppm) were the major polyphenols identified in WB and IR extracts, as determined by HPLC.

Therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of Merlot and Syrah grape pomace extracts obtained by supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) and CO2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees C. The results were compared with the ones obtained by Soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. The main components from the extracts, identified by HPLC, were gallic acid, p-OH-benzoic acid, vanillic acid and epicatechin. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei). Despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of antimicrobial active compounds.

This study aimed to characterize and compare Sanguisorba species in order to highlight which species is more valuable according to phenolic profile and antimicrobial activity. Based on high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detection and mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization) (HPLC-DAD-MS (ESI+)) analysis, it was evident that the ethanol extract obtained from the leaves of S. minor Scop. contains the highest content of phenolic compounds at 160.96 mg/g p.s., followed by the flower and root extract (131.56 mg/g dw and 121.36 mg/g dw, respectively). While in S. officinalis, the highest amount of phenols was recorded in the root extract (127.06 mg/g), followed by the flower and leaves extract (102.31 mg/g and 81.09 mg/g dw, respectively). Our results show that among the two species, S. minor Scop. is richer in phenolic compounds compared with the S. officinalis L. sample. In addition, the antimicrobial potential of each plant organ of Sanguisorba species was investigated. The ethanol extract of S. minor Scop. leaves exhibited better antibacterial activity against all of the bacteria tested, especially on Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone of 15.33 +/- 0.83 mm.

Chemical tests and spectrophotometric methods were used for screening and quantification of phytochemicals. The assessment of the antioxidant activity was accomplished by DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging assays. Extracts were evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy by diffusion and microdilution methods. Biofilm inhibition was tested using XTT assay and the cytotoxicity of extracts was carried out on Vero cell line. The GC-FID analysis revealed that E. alata was rich in unsatured fatty acids. In addition, the aqueous extract had the highest flavonoid and protein contents (30.82 mg QE /g dry extract and 98.92 mg BSAE/g dry extract respectively). However, the methanolic extract had the highest phenolic, sugars and tannins. The antioxidant activity demonstrated that the aqueous extract exhibited the strong potency (IC50 ranged between 0.001 and 0.002 mg/mL). Both extracts displayed antimicrobial activity on Gram negative and positive strains. They were effective against S. aureus isolated from auricular infections. The tested extracts were able to inhibit biofilm formation with concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells line was demonstrated for the extracts. Overall, our findings highlight the potential use of E. alata extract as a novel source of bioactive molecules with antioxidant, antibacterial and antiobiofilm effects for the control of infectious disease especially those associated to S. aureus methicillin resistant.

Cheese provides favourable conditions for microbial growth and oxidative degradation due to the presence of water, fat, protein, and minerals. The present work thus aimed to determine the influence of Nigella sativa L. essential oil on microbial growth and oxidative stability of cheese made from fresh milk. The analysis of the chemical composition of N. sativa essential oil was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main compounds detected were 9,12octadecadienoic acid (27.96%), cis-vaccenic acid (20.69%), 6-epi-shyobunol (7.08%), benzene, 1-methyl-3-(1-methylethyl)- (6.33%), n-hexadecanoic acid (3.86%), o-cymene (2.77%), and cis-4-methoxy thujane (2.71%). The antioxidant activity of N. sativa essential oil was calculated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method with IC50 = 8.08 mu g/mL. The microdilution test showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of N. sativa essential oil for all pathogens was 500 mu g/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 1,000 mu g/mL for Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, and 2,000 mu g/mL for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The physicochemical properties of the cheese showed that the addition of essential oil did not affect the dry matter, but increased the pH, decreased the % acidity, and decreased the peroxide value compared to the control sample (sample without essential oil). In addition, the essential oil reduced the bacterial and fungal counts of the cheese compared to the control sample, and affected the sensory characteristics of the cheese during the 90-day storage period. Results also showed that the addition of 0.5% essential oil of N. sativa not only prevented microbial growth and oxidative degradation, but also improved the taste and overall acceptability of cheese.",INTERNATIONAL FOOD RESEARCH JOURNAL,UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,cheese; essential oil; Nigella sativa L; antioxidant activity; antibacterial activity,FOOD-BORNE PATHOGENS; THYMOQUINONE; BACTERIA; QUALITY,"[Al-Kaabi, Ab; Davati, N.; Karami, M.] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Food Ind, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Hamadan 65178 38695, Iran",Nigella sativa,,Ranunculaceae,,noise,noise,"Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus","positive, negative, negative, positive",,Nigella sativa,Ranunculaceae,Nigella,Iran

MAE is an efficient approach compared to maceration. In our study of N. pulmonarioides, the Folin-Ciocalteu and trichloroaluminum techniques were used to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Antioxidant activity was determined by the beta-carotene/linoleic acid test. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured using the microwell dilution assay method. Overall, MAE may represent a substantially faster extraction system (5 min) with an even greater extraction yield than maceration extraction (24 h). Phytochemical screening indicated the existence of classes of several secondary metabolites. The methanol extract had a high total phenolic content (TPC) of 113.33 +/- 1.06 mu g of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mg of dry plant weight, while the total flavonoid content (TFC) in the acetone extract was 44.26 +/- 0.88 mu g of quercetin equivalent (QE)/mg of the dry plant. The antioxidant activity data correlated well with the acetone extract (32.41 +/- 0.93, I%) compared to the other extracts.

Oliver is a customary African medicinal plant, which has a long history of utilization in the management of oxidative stress-induced and bacterial diseases. However, there is no report on the phytochemicals, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of its leaves. The aim of this study was therefore to compare the phytochemicals, antioxidant, and antibacterial potential of A. coriaria leaves from Jinja, Kole, and Mbarara districts of Uganda. Shade-dried leaf samples were ground into powder and successively extracted with ethyl acetate, ethanol, and distilled water. Phytochemical screening indicated the presence of alkaloids, phenols, saponins, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, tannins, and terpenes as the major secondary metabolites in the extracts. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents and total in vitro antioxidant activity were found to be the highest for ethanolic extracts, with the highest contents (101.72 +/- 0.22 mg GAE/g DW; 13.23 +/- 0.03 mg QE/g DW) and antioxidant potential (IC50 = 18.65 +/- 0.06 mg/mL) being for leaves from Mbarara district. Antibacterial activity of the extracts determined by agar disc diffusion method revealed that ethanolic extracts had higher antibacterial activities with mean zones of inhibition of 6.00 +/- 1.73 to 10.00 +/- 1.73 mm, 5.00 +/- 1.00 to 12.30 +/- 1.53 mm, 17.00 +/- 0.00 to 25.00 +/- 2.65 mm, and 9.00 +/- 1.73 to 16.00 +/- 1.73 mm for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi, respectively.

A previous study of our research group optimized the extraction of phenolic compounds from Juglans regia by heat-assisted extraction. Due to its richness in different phenolic compounds, the present work aimed to develop a formulation containing J. regia leaf extract. The extract's antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, cytotoxicity, and photostability properties were evaluated. The extract was then incorporated into an O/W base cream, followed by characterization of the final formulation in terms of its antioxidant properties, phenolic composition, and stability over time and at different storage conditions. The most abundant compounds in the hydroethanolic extract were 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (18.30 +/- 0.04 mg/g), quercetin-O-pentoside (9.64 +/- 0.06 mg/g), and quercetin 3-O-glucoside (6.70 +/- 0.19 mg/g). Besides those, the extract presented antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, wound closure, and antibacterial effects against several skin pathogens. In addition, HaCaT cell viability was maintained up to 98% at 400 mu g/mL. Within Proteus vulgaris-infected HaCaT cells, the extract also presented an over 40% bacterial mortality rate at its nontoxic concentration (200 mu g/mL). After incorporating the extract, the obtained formulation presented a good physicochemical profile over time and at different storage conditions while also maintaining its antioxidant effect; as such, it can be considered stable for topical application.

As metabolically active plant metabolites, polyphenols are food components with a wide range of biological activities. Given their poor absorbability in the digestive tract their activity toward the human host is typically mediated through interaction with intestinal microbes. As a result, polyphenols comprise a novel group of prebiotics. In this study, we tested the effect of five polyphenol-rich extracts from four medicinal herbs on the growth of probiotic and pathogenic microbes. The studied medicinal herbs were Gentiana asclepiadea L. (willow gentian), Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort), Satureja montana L. (winter savory), and Achillea millefolium L. (yarrow). All these plants are traditionally used for the treatment of digestive problems. Extracts were prepared using safe solvent combinations. We tested the impact of addition of plant extracts on the growth of three probiotic lactobacilli and probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. The effect of addition of plant extracts to liquid media (concentration range 0.25-10 mg/mL) on the growth of probiotics, was tested in vitro. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against several opportunistic bacteria and yeast. St. John's wort, winter savory, and willow gentian extracts showed a stimulative effect on probiotic yeast growth, while the highest growth-stimulating effect was achieved when microwave-assisted yarrow extract was used in the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Under these conditions growth of S. boulardii was increased 130-fold. In addition, the yarrow extract stimulated the growth of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v. The growth of two Lacticasibacillus rhamnosus strains was not stimulated by the addition of any extracts. Our results show that plant polyphenol-rich extracts can influence the growth of microorganisms that are typical members of the intestinal microbiota. For the first time we demonstrate that probiotic yeast growth can be stimulated by extracts of medicinal herbs, which when accompanied by suppression of Candida yeasts suggests a potential benefit of the treatment in diseases that are associated with fungal dysbiosis.",FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,prebiotics; medicinal herbs; polyphenols; antimicrobial activity; Gentiana asclepiadea L.; Hypericum perforatum L.; Satureja montana L.; Achillea millefolium L.,ACHILLEA-MILLEFOLIUM L.; IN-VITRO; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; HYPERICUM-PERFORATUM; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SACCHAROMYCES-BOULARDII; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; GUT MICROBIOTA,"[Milutinovic, Milica; Dimitrijevic-Brankovic, Suzana; Rajilic-Stojanovic, Mirjana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Dept Biochem Engn & Biotechnol, Belgrade, Serbia","Achillea millefolium, Gentiana asclepiadea, Satureja montana, Hypericum perforatum",,"Asteraceae, Gentianaceae, Lamiaceae, Hypericaceae",,"phenolics, phenolics","phenolics, phenolics",Lactiplantibacillus plantarum,positive,,"Achillea millefolium, Gentiana asclepiadea, Satureja montana, Hypericum perforatum","Asteraceae, Gentianaceae, Lamiaceae, Hypericaceae","Achillea, Gentiana, Satureja, Hypericum",Serbia

In the context of increasing concern on the safety of chemical additives and at the sight of the side effects of heat treatments on food quality, natural techniques of preservation are receiving a particular attention. Hence, the effects of tamarind leaf extracts on the physicochemical attributes and microbial quality of the folere beverage through storage were assessed. Firstly, phytochemical and antimicrobial properties of 4 extracts (aqueous, hexane, ethanolic, and acetone) were studied, then the 2 most active extracts were selected. The beverage was prepared using the hot water technique, the nectar obtained was mixed with extracts, and both physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the blended folere samples were investigated for 5 days at room temperature during which the stability and shelf-life of the samples were evaluated. Ethanolic and acetone extracts showed the highest total polyphenol (9.25 +/- 0.02 mg of PE/g and 18.64 +/- 0.02 mg of PE/g) and flavonoid (94.11 +/- 0.01 mg of QE/g and 138.42 +/- 0.07 mg of QE/g) contents. Acetone extract exhibited by far the best antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and fungi tested. This antimicrobial activity of extracts against Bacillus cereus (r = 0.969; p < 0.05), Bacillus subtilis (r = 0.978; p < 0.05), Aspergillus sp. (r = 0.952; p < 0.05) were positively and significantly correlated to the flavonoids content. A total of 4 and 12 bioactive compounds were identified in ethanolic and acetone extracts, with oleic acid as one of the most relevant compounds in both extracts.

Roma) and its Antimicrobial Activity against Eye Infecting Pathogens,"The essential oil from the rhizomes of Roma cultivar of turmeric (Curcuma longa) from Orissa was examined for its antimicrobial activity against the pathogens causing eye infections. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation extraction method using Clevenger apparatus. Chemical analysis of the oil was done by using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The antimicrobial effects of oil towards Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger were tested by inhibition zone diameter (IZD) test to screen the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test and minimum killing time (MKT) test to determine the minimum concentration of oil and minimum time required to kill the pathogens. Oil showed very good activity against all four microbial strains used at concentration of 10 mu L except Pseudomonas aerugenosa. Very low concentration of 1.95 mu L/mL oil was needed to inhibit the growth of most highly infecting pathogen Staphylococcus aureus within 15 min of its exposure in comparison to other microbial strains. High turmerone content (49.76%) of elite turmeric cultivar Roma released from Orissa (India) might be assigned to be responsible for such excellent anti microbial activity against the tested pathogens.

However, there is a lack of information on human skin penetration of active ingredients with antioxidative potential. It seems crucial because bacterial infections of skin and subcutaneous tissue are common and partly depend on oxidative stress. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro human skin penetration of fireweed ethanol-water extracts (FEEs) by determining antioxidant activity of these extracts before and after penetration study using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and Folin-Ciocalteu methods.

Their phytochemical properties and the possibility of plant-part substitution as a conservation strategy against destructive harvesting (use of aerial parts and roots) of these species for medicinal purposes were also investigated. Microtitre plate assays were used in determining their antifungal (against Candida albicans) and acetylcholinesterase inhibition activities. All the extracts demonstrated both fungistatic and fungicidal activities with the minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.78 to 9.38 mg/ml and minimum fungicidal concentration ranging from 1.17 to 12.50 mg/ml. The higher inhibitory activity of B. greenii leaf extracts in most cases compared to similar extracts of the stems and roots suggest the potential of B. greenii leaves in plant-part substitution. At the lowest extract concentration (0.156 mg/ml), the leaf extract of B. greenii demonstrated a significantly higher acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition than its stem and root extracts. In B. albostellata, the AChE inhibitory activity demonstrated by the stem was significantly greater than that recorded in its leaf extract. These findings suggest that the idea of plant part substitution may be species and/or biological activity dependent. In the DPPH radical scavenging assay, different parts of Barleria species showed free radical scavenging activity with EC50 values ranging from 6.65 to 12.56 mu g/ml. The ability of the extracts from different plant parts to reduce ferric ion/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form and decrease carotenoid bleaching rate suggests the presence of antioxidant compounds capable of donating electrons and hydrogen atoms in their reaction mechanisms. Flavonoids, iridoids and tannins were detected in the different parts of these Barleria species. These phytochemicals might be responsible for the observed biological activities. The isolation of specific bioactive compounds through bioassay-guided fractionation and their characterization as well as studies evaluating their safety may be necessary in the exploration of these species for potential new therapeutic drugs or drug leads.

The phytochemical composition of S. ebulus fruit extracts was identified by LC-MS/MS. The antimicrobial activity was examined by using the broth microdilution method against a panel of microorganisms. In addition to this, S. ebulus extracts were evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activity against three yeast and T. rubrum by disc diffusion method. Results: The major compounds were determined in dried fruit methanol extract (DFM) as hederagenin (5.38 +/- 0.4949 mu g/g) and fumaric acid (3.06 +/- 0.0275 mu g/g). The fumaric acid (3.97 +/- 0.0357 mu g/g) was detected as the abundant compound in the fresh fruit juice (FFJ). Acacetin, chrysin, eupatilin, hederagenin, isosakuranetin, myricitrin, and rhamnocitrin were detected in the extracts for the first time. DFM showed moderate activity against E. coli (MIC: 625 mg/L) and Candida tropicalis (MIC: 312.5 mg/L).

These activities are mainly derived from the organosulfur compounds (OSCs). Propyl propane thiosulfinate (PTS) is an OSC with potential use in the active packaging, but its safety should be guaranteed before being commercialized. The aim of this work was to investigate for the first time the cytotoxicity of PTS as well as its in vitro mutagenic/genotoxic potential using the following battery of genotoxicity tests:(1)the bacterial reverse-mutation assay in S. typhimurium (Ames test, OECD 471, 1997); (2) the micronucleus test (MN, OECD 487, 2016); (3) the mouse lymphoma thymidine-kinase assay (MLA, OECD 476, 2015), and (4) the comet assay (standard and modified with restriction enzymes). The results revealed that PTS was not mutagenic neither in the Ames test nor in MLA. However, genotoxic effects were recorded in the MN test on mammalian cells (L5178YTk(+/-)cells) after PTS exposure at the highest concentration tested (17.25 mu M) without S9, and also its metabolites (+S9, from 20 mu M). Moreover, in the comet assay, PTS induced DNA breaks damage in Caco-2 cells at the highest concentration tested (280 mu M) but it did not induce oxidative DNA damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, comprehensively exploring and utilizing the leaves will inevitably reduce the associated resource waste and environment pollution. In this study, the plant leaves were processed into tea using green tea processing technology. Bioactive components, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the Leaf Tea (LT) and Dry Leaves (DL) were studied, and compared to that of the Dry Roots (DR). The results showed that the polysaccharides content (POL) in the DR (20.44%) was twice as high as the DL (10.18%) and LT (8.68%). However, the DL contained 36.85% more water-soluble extracts (WSE), 35.09% more ethanol-soluble extracts (ESE), 409.63% more total flavonoid content (TFC), 221.01% more total phenolic content (TPC) and 94.34% more proteins, and the LT contained 26.21% more WSE, 40.64% more ESE, 326.93% more TFC, 191.90% more TPC and 37.71% more proteins.

The objective of this research is to enhance the water extraction of polyphenols through the water bath (WB) technique and to evaluate the antiradical, antibacterial, and anticancer effects of the extract. (2) Methods: Response Surface Methodology was used to find the best parameters to extract polyphenols. Three experimental parameters, time, temperature, and solid-liquid ratio, were tested. The disc diffusion method has been used to determine the antimicrobial activities against Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The antiradical activity was performed using the DPPH method, while total phenolic content was performed using Folin-Ciocalteu. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was conducted to analyze the phytochemical profile of WB extracts. The anticancer activity of the lyophilized extract was assessed against three cancer cell lines (colon (HT29), lung (A549), and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines).; (3) Results: The optimal conditions for water extraction were 130 min at 72 degrees C. The total phenolic compounds yield (14.7 mg GAE/g DM) and antioxidant activity (0.52 mg trolox eq./mL) were obtained using a 1:40 solid-liquid ratio. The primary polyphenols identified were the flavonoids rutin (0.1 ppm) and ellagic acid (3.78 ppm). The extract had no antibacterial or antifungal activities against the microorganisms tested. The extract showed anticancer activity of about 98% against MCF7 (breast cancer cell line), about 81% against HT29 (colon cancer cell line), and 85% against A549 (lung cancer cell line) at high doses.

However, this plant is still underexplored in the modern scientific era. Specifically, the leaves of the plant are reported to contain various medicinal properties such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activity. Herewith, the present work demonstrates and optimizes the extraction process using an ultrasonic system and comopared the results with conventional extraction methods. Optimization was performed by combining first and second-order polynomial designs at different levels using Plackett Burman and Central-Composite designs. A total of 31 experiments were conducted at different levels, including ultrasonic power (10-40 %), solvent-to-sample ratio (20-50 mL/g), solvent concentration (50-80 %), and HCl normality (0.2-1 N). The findings of the study suggest a significant (p<0.05) influence of extraction parameters on the extraction yield of the response variables, including total phenol (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), total tannin (TTC), and the antioxidants activity. Further, the predicted values demonstrated good agreement with the experimental values, exhibiting a high (R-2>95%) coefficient of determination and a non-significant lack of fit. At the optimized condition, the experimental values of TPC, TFC, TTC and antioxidants (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) activity were found near the model predicted values.

Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity of CMF was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheltetrazolium (MTT) assay against a healthy fibroblast (L929) cell line. Results: The CMF ethanol extract was revealed to have substantial phenol and flavonoid content (113.71 +/- 0.04 mg gallic acid/g dried extract and 68.9 +/- 0.002 mg quercetin/g dried extract, respectively) that showed the highest percentage of DPPH inhibition (86.45%), which was achieved by ethanol extract at the concentration of 60 mu g/ml,with excellent antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, S. enterica, B. subtilis, and P. aeruginosa (17.5 +/- 1.0, 14.9 +/- 1.0, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 15.7 +/- 1.0, and 13.8 +/- 1.5 mm IZ, respectively). In addition, no expressive antiproliferative effect was recorded in the assessment of cytotoxicity on L929 cells.

We examined the antimicrobial mechanism of blueberry extract in the regulation of the seven membrane genes expression. The MIC for V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802, ATCC 33847 and F 13 was 25, 25 and 12.5 mg/mL, respectively, whereas the MBC was 50, 50 and 25 mg/mL, respectively. The blueberry extract has antimicrobial effect on V. parahaemolyticus in salmon samples. The V. parahaemolyticus exposed to 1 x MIC showed distorted membrane morphology and leakage of cellular contents. The cytoplasmic constituents were aggregated, causing a wide range of hollow areas in the cells. The expression of seven membrane genes in V. parahaemolyticus treated with blueberry extract was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to that in the control, the gene expression of fadL and nusA was upregulated by 1.1-, 2.1-, 4.1-fold and 7.4-, 4.3-, 3.6-fold in V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802, ATCC 33847 and F 13, respectively. The gene expression of ef-Tu was downregulated by 1.1-, 2.7-, 3.3-fold in the three strains of V. parahaemolyticus. Findings from this study revealed that blueberry extract had strong antibacterial effect and inhibited gene transcription to disrupt cell membrane structure and energy transport. Further studies investigating potential antimicrobial applications of blueberry extract are necessary to provide a basis for the development and utilization of blueberries as an antimicrobial agent.",FOOD CONTROL,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Blueberry extract; Minimal inhibitory concentration; Minimal bactericidal concentration; Cell membrane; Gene expression,ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ESSENTIAL OIL; LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; GENE-EXPRESSION; VIRULENCE; SEAFOOD; GROWTH; MODE,"[Sun, Xiao-hong; Hao, Li-ran; Xie, Qing-chao; Lan, Wei-qing; Zhao, Yong; Pan, Ying-jie] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiao-hong; Xie, Qing-chao; Zhao, Yong; Pan, Ying-jie] Minist Agr, Lab Qual & Safety Risk Assessment Aquat Prod Stor, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Lan, Wei-qing] Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Aquat Prod Proc & Preservat, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Wu, Vivian C.

Moench Essential Oils","Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench is a medicinal plant commonly used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, the common cold, sore throat, migraine, colic, stomach cramps, and toothaches and the promotion of wound healing. Based on the known pharmacological properties of essential oils (EOs), we hypothesized that E. purpurea EOs may contribute to these medicinal properties. In this work, EOs from the flowers of E. purpurea were steam-distilled and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), GC with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID), and chiral GC-MS. The EOs were also evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial and innate immunomodulatory activity. About 87 compounds were identified in five samples of the steam-distilled E. purpurea EO. The major components of the E. purpurea EO were germacrene D (42.0 +/- 4.61%), alpha-phellandrene (10.09 +/- 1.59%), beta-caryophyllene (5.75 +/- 1.72%), gamma-curcumene (5.03 +/- 1.96%), alpha-pinene (4.44 +/- 1.78%), delta-cadinene (3.31 +/- 0.61%), and beta-pinene (2.43 +/- 0.98%). Eleven chiral compounds were identified in the E. purpurea EO, including alpha-pinene, sabinene, beta-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, limonene, beta-phellandrene, alpha-copaene, beta-elemene, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and delta-cadinene. Analysis of E. purpurea EO antimicrobial activity showed that they inhibited the growth of several bacterial species, although the EO did not seem to be effective for Staphylococcus aureus. The E. purpurea EO and its major components induced intracellular calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. Additionally, pretreatment of human neutrophils with the E. purpurea EO or (+)-delta-cadinene suppressed agonist-induced neutrophil calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Moreover, pharmacophore mapping studies predicted two potential MAPK targets for (+)-delta-cadinene. Our results are consistent with previous reports on the innate immunomodulatory activities of delta-caryophyllene, alpha-phellandrene, and germacrene D. Thus, this study identified delta-cadinene as a novel neutrophil agonist and suggests that 5-cadinene may contribute to the reported immunomodulatory activity of E. purpurea.",MOLECULES,MDPI,Echinacea purpurea; purple coneflower; essential oil; antimicrobial activity; (+)-delta-cadinene; calcium flux; neutrophil; chemotaxis,RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTIONS; HUMAN NEUTROPHIL RESPONSES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; BETA-CARYOPHYLLENE; CALCIUM FLUX; PREVENTION; EXTRACT; ANGUSTIFOLIA; CONSTITUENTS; ANTIOXIDANT,"[Dosoky, Noura S.; Satyal, Prabodh] doTERRA Int, Essential Oil Sci, 1248 W 700 S, Pleasant Grove, UT 84062 United States of America; [Kirpotina, Liliya N.; Schepetkin, Igor A.; Quinn, Mark T.] Montana State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Cell Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 United States of America; [Khlebnikov, Andrei I.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Kizhner Res Ctr, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Lisonbee, Brent L.; Black, Jeffrey L.; Thurgood, Trever L.] Utah Valley Univ, Innova Bio, 800 W Univ Pkwy, Orem, UT 84058 United States of America; [Woolf, Hillary; Graf, Brittany L.] doTERRA Int, Res & Dev, 389 S 1300 W, Pleasant Grove, UT 84062 United States of America",Echinacea purpurea,,Asteraceae,,noise,noise,Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Echinacea purpurea,Asteraceae,Echinacea,United States

Hochr. (Fabaceae) is a native Amazonian tree, popularly known as barbatimao. The stem barks of this tree are widely used in folk medicine to treat infections, cutaneous and ulcerative wounds, under the form of a suspension of the bark-derived powder. The present study aimed to investigate the in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the ethanolic extract of S. pulcherrimum (SPEE). Likewise, to putatively identify the active compounds of the extract by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Therefore, we aimed to rationalize this observation by turning the bark powder-derived suspension into an ointment (SPEEO) incorporating SPEE (20% w/v). Both the antibacterial action and the acute dermal toxicity were evaluated in rats as animal model. Mortality, body weight changes, feed and water intake, organ weights, histological and biochemical parameters were measured for 14 days post-treatment with no major sign of toxicity. The SPEE showed excellent in vitro antibacterial activity (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration = 100 mg/m L) against Staphylococcus aureus and no in vivo acute dermal toxicity. The SPEEO inhibited up to 85% bacterial growth in a petri dish, with better results than the control standard ointment (Kollagenase (R)). We putatively identified 13 compounds present in the SPEE, belonging to the class of tannins, including one trimer and two dimers of catechin. Thereby, the data showed SPEEO as a potent antibacterial candidate for herbal medicine preparation. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Leaves Extract as Functional Ingredient","Vaccinium myrtillus L. (bilberry) leaves are an important by-product of berry production that may be used as a source of phenolic compounds which have a positive effect on human health. Therefore, an ultrasound-assisted extraction via sonotrode has been used for the first time to recover bioactive compounds from bilberry leaves. The extraction has been optimized using a Box-Behnken design. The influence of ethanol:water ratio (v/v), time of extraction (min) and amplitude (%) were evaluated considering total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP assays) as dependent variables in a response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum values for the independent factors were 30:70 ethanol/water (v/v), 5 min of extraction and 55% amplitude. The empirical values of the independent variables using the optimized conditions were 217.03 +/- 4.92 mg GAE/g d.w. (TPC), 271.13 +/- 5.84 mg TE/g d.w. (DPPH) and 312.21 +/- 9.30 mg TE/g d.w. (FRAP). The validity of the experimental design was confirmed using ANOVA and the optimal extract was characterized using HPLC-MS. A total of 53 compounds were tentatively identified, of which 22 were found in bilberry leaves for the first time. Among them, chlorogenic acid was the most abundant molecule, representing 53% of the total phenolic compounds identified. Additionally, the antimicrobial and anticancer activities of the optimum extract were tested. Gram-positive bacteria demonstrated high sensitivity to bilberry leaves extract in vitro, with MBC values of 6.25 mg/mL for Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus faecalis, and 0.8 mg/mL for Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Furthermore, bilberry leaves extract exerted in vitro antiproliferative activity against HT-29, T-84 and SW-837 colon tumor cells with IC50 values of 213.2 +/- 2.5, 1140.3 +/- 5.2 and 936.5 +/- 4.6 mu g/mL, respectively.

The first two honey samples were monofloral from chestnut and rhododendron flowers, collected from the east Black Sea region, and the third sample was the heterofloral form of astragalus (Astragalus microcephalus Willd.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and other several mountain flowers, collected from Erzincan in Eastern Anatolia. The chemical properties of the honey samples, such as total moisture, ash, total protein, sucrose, invert sugar, diastase activity, hydroxymethylfurfural content and acidity, were determined. Total phenolics, superoxide radical- and peroxynitrite-scavenging activities, and ferric reducing/antioxidant power measurements were used as antioxidant capacity determinants with +/--catechin, butylated hydroxytoluene, ascorbic acid, and trolox (R) used as reference. The antimicrobial activity was studied by the agar diffusion method, using eight bacteria and two yeasts. The mineral contents were also determined by an AAS method. The chestnut flower honey had the highest phenolic content, superoxide radical- scavenging activity and reducing power, while the heterofloral honey sample exhibited the highest peroxynitrite-scavenging activity. The antioxidant activities were also found to be related to the sample concentrations. The mineral content of the chestnut honey was much higher than the others. The samples showed moderate antimicrobial activity against some microorganisms, especially Helicobacter pylori ATCC 49503, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Candida tropicalis ATCC 13803 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231.

In the present study, hydrolysates from three wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) marcs were characterized and their antifungal activities against phytopathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria spp.) were evaluated. Wine grape marcs (red, pink and white wine) collected from Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, were subjected to an acid hydrolysis treatment. Skin hydrolysates of pink and white marcs obtained high concentrations of reducing sugars (5.8 +/- 0.1 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 g L-1, respectively). Meanwhile, the highest concentration of total sugars was obtained for skin hydrolysates of white marc (9.7 +/- 0.08 g L-1). The seed hydrolysates of white marc obtained high concentrations of phenolic compounds (0.52 +/- 0.1 mg mL(-1)). In addition, the highest antioxidant activity was found for skin hydrolysates of red marc (96 +/- 0.61%). Results of in vitro antifungal assays clearly indicated a marked inhibition of the mycelial growth and spore viability of F. oxysporum (100% inhibition using red and white hydrolysates) rather than Alternaria spp. (58% inhibition exposed to pink hydrolysates), due to high concentration of phenols. According to HPLC analysis, phenolic acids such as gallic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid and p-coumaric acid were predominant in the hydrolysates. This study demonstrated that the grape marc hydrolysates exhibit a potential antifungal activity, and highlights that the hydrolysates can be exploited in agriculture as a safe alternative of antifungal agents.",CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,INST INVESTIGACIONES AGROPECUARIAS,Antifungal activity; grape marcs; hydrolysates; phenolic acids; phytopathogenic fungi; Vitis vinifera,PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; FUSARIUM-OXYSPORUM; RESISTANCE; EXTRACTS; EUGENOL; POMACE,"[Tzintzun-Camacho, Ia; Hernandez-Jimenez, Valeria; Gonzalez-Mendoza, Daniel; Pedro Perez-Perez, Juan; Duran-Hernandez, Dagoberto; Cecena-Duran, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Ciencias Agr, Carretera Delta S-N, Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico; [Troncoso-Rojas, Rosalba] Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo AC, Coordinac Tecnol Alimentos Origen Vegetal, Carretera Gustavo Enrique Astiazaran Rosas 46, Hermosillo 83304, Sonora, Mexico; [Francisco Moreno-Cruz, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Av San Rafael Atlixco 186, Ciudad De Mexico 09340, Mexico",Fu,"Alternaria spp, Fusarium oxysporum, Vitis vinifera",,", , Vitaceae","phenolics, coumarins, phenolics","phenolics, coumarins, phenolics",,,Fusarium oxysporum,"Alternaria spp, Fusarium oxysporum, Vitis vinifera",", , Vitaceae","Alternaria, Fusarium, Vitis",Mexico

The highest concentration of these compounds is found in the peel (exocarp and mesocarp), which constitutes about 50% of the whole fresh fruit. These bioactive phytochemicals exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. In the present paper, the chemical compo-sition and antimicrobial activity of the peel (exocarp and mesocarp) from seven Punica granatum varieties (Wonderful, Mollar de Elche, Primosole, Sassari 1, Sassari 2, Sassari 3, and Arbara Druci) grown in Sardinia (Italy) were evaluated. Polar phenols, flavonoids, condensed tannins, and an-thocyanin contents were evaluated by extraction with water at 20 and 40 degrees C. Orthogonal projec-tions to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to characterize each variety according to the chemical composition of the pomegranate peel extracts (PPEs). The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of each PPE were further tested in vitro against Staphyloccocus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella bongori, Escherichia coli, Lacticaseibacillus casei and Limosilac-tobacillus reuteri. Gram-positive species were more sensitive than Gram-negative to the extracts tested. Antimicrobial activity was shown against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes strains, whereas less, even no activity was found against S. bongori and E. coli strains. The PPEs from Mollar de Elche, Primosole, and Sassari 3 showed the highest antimicrobial activities at concentrations that varied from 0.19 to 1.50 mg/mL, with biofilm activity being reduced by more than 70%. These activities were positively related to the punicalagin, flavonoid, and chlorogenic acid content of the extracts. Finally, regarding the pro-technological bacterial strains, La . casei and Li. reuteri showed very low, even no sensitivity to the used of the specific PPEs with high concentrations. This study proposes a formulation of pomegranate peel extract that valorizes agro-industrial waste in the context of sustainability and circular economy.

After purification with AB-8 macroporous resin, the phenolics (RMAP) was obtained with a purity of 80.50 +/- 0.26%. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and inhibition zone tests showed that RMAP exhibited more potent antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus than against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Additionally, high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis confirmed RMAP was mainly composed of four phenolic compounds including kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and hyperoside. MIC and time-kill curve assays indicated that C3G displayed the highest inhibitory activity on S. aureus among four compounds. Moreover, crystal violet and MTT assays showed that C3G exhibited obviously inhibitory effect on fresh biofilm formation of S. aureus. Transmission electron microscopy observation, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, protein and DNA leakage assays verified that C3G damaged cell wall and membrane of S. aureus. On the other hand, UV absorption spectroscopy and DNA cleavage assay revealed that C3G was able to interact with DNA in the form of chimera, but had no direct effect on DNA cleavage. Whereas, DNA topoisomerase IV (DNA Topo IV) inhibition assay and molecular docking model manifested that C3G could combine with DNA Topo IV to affect its activity and further restrained the synthesis of DNA. These results indicated that the antibacterial mechanism of C3G against S. aureus was mainly related to its inhibiting biofilm formation, disrupting cell structure and resisting DNA Topo IV activity.",FOOD CONTROL,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction; Phenolic compounds; Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside; Antibacterial mechanism; Molecular docking,BLACK-CURRANT; ESSENTIAL OIL; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; MECHANISM; POLYSACCHARIDES; QUANTIFICATION; BERRIES; LEAVES; FRUITS; ACID,"[Zhao, Meimei; Bai, Jingwen; Bu, Xueying; Tang, Yang; Han, Wenqing; Wang, Libo; Yang, Yu; Xu, Yaqin] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Art & Sci, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China; [Li, Dalong] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China",Ribes nigrum,,Grossulariaceae,,"phenolics, phenolics","phenolics, phenolics","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Ribes nigrum,Grossulariaceae,Ribes,China

Sch. Bip. Herb Extract Enriched with Flavonoids and an Evaluation of Its Biological Activity,"The development of new drugs derived from plant sources is of significant interest in modern pharmacy. One of the promising plant sources for introduction into pharmaceuticals is Tripleurospermum inodorum (L.) Sch. Bip., also known as Tripleurospermum perforatum (Merat.) M. This plant has been shown to possess various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antimycotic activities, among others. However, a review of the current literature reveals a paucity of studies investigating the chemical composition of the herb Tripleurospermum inodorum (L.) Sch. Bip. This study presents the development of a method for obtaining an extract of the herb Tripleurospermum inodorum (L.) Sch. Bip. enriched with flavonoids, harvested before flowering and butonization. This study focused on determining the optimal conditions for extraction, including the concentration of the extractant (ethanol), extraction time, raw material/extractant ratio, extraction frequency, complexation reaction time, amount of aluminum chloride solution, and amount of diluted acetic acid. The results indicate that herbs harvested during this specific period exhibited a higher flavonoid content compared to those collected during butonization and flowering. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the flavonoid content could exceed 7% mg REq/100 g D.W. through a one-hour extraction process. Furthermore, the flavonoid content was found to be 7.65 +/- 0.03 mg REq/100 g D.W. following a three-minute ultrasound-assisted extraction process, followed by thermal extraction. A qualitative analysis identified a variety of phenolic compounds in the extract, such as chlorogenic acid, 5-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 1-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid, luteolin-7-glucoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, luteolin-7-rutinoside, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercetin-3-O-malonylglucoside, apigenin-7-glucoside, luteolin-3-malonylglucoside, cynarin, rhamnetin-3-(O-dimethyl rhamnosyl glucosylglucoside), and luteolin. Moreover, this study demonstrated the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, anti-aggregation, and antioxidant activities of the aqueous alcoholic extract from T. inodorum herb (ETIH) against pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Additionally, the extract exhibited comparable anti-inflammatory effects on diclofenac sodium.

The two different extraction procedures (Sonication and ultrasonic assisted base hydrolysis) and their antimicrobial activity against two bacteria i.e. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were analyzed. The RP-HPLC-DAD was applied for separation and detection of phenolic compounds (PC). The HPLC profiling revealed the existence of 13 PC in which 11 were phenolic acids and 2 aldehydes derivatives, while bound PC possessing greater fraction than free ones. The results from ultrasonic assisted extraction revealed the gallic (23.47 mg/g), p-coumaric (16.66 mg/g), p-hyroxybenzoic (11.03 mg/g) and ferulic (8.71 mg/g) acids. While Sonication extraction method shows the chlorogenic (8.14 mg/g), vanillic (11.47 mg/g), sinapic (4.68 mg/g) and caffeic (5.38 mg/g) acids as main constituents in skin, seed, stem and leaves respectively. Four PC were identified as bound phenolic acids i.e., p-coumaric, cinnamic, naringenin and catechin, while other of the compounds were found in both extracts. The free radical scavenging activity (RSA) and total phenolic contents (TPC) were present in greater amounts in seed (164.61 Mm/g) and skin (118.96 Mm/g) while total flavonoids and total tannins were higher in stem (42.77 Mm/g) and (28.13 Mm/g), respectively. E. Tereticornis leaves, stem, seeds and skin extracts were observed to be highly effective for E coli and S. aureus. The antimicrobial action of E. Tereticornis extracts was higher against S. aureus (MIC value 125 mu g/mL) than E. coli (MIC value 250 mu g/mL).

Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction of MO leaves for in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant, and wound healing activities and conduct gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Materials and Methods: Antibacterial activity was evaluated against six Gram-positive bacteria and 10 Gram-negative bacteria by disc diffusion method. Free radical scavenging activity was assessed by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical hydrogen peroxide scavenging and total phenolic content (TPC). Wound healing efficiency was studied using cell viability, proliferation, and scratch assays in diabetic human dermal fibroblast (HDF-D) cells. Results: The EtOAc fraction showed moderate activity against all bacterial strains tested, and the maximum inhibition zone was observed against Streptococcus pyogenes (30 mm in diameter). The fraction showed higher sensitivity to Gram-positive strains than Gram-negative strains. In the quantitative analysis of antioxidant content, the EtOAc fraction was found to have a TPC of 65.81 +/- 0.01. The DPPH scavenging activity and the hydrogen peroxide assay were correlated with the TPC value, with IC50 values of 18.21 +/- 0.06 and 59.22 +/- 0.04, respectively. The wound healing experiment revealed a significant enhancement of cell proliferation and migration of HDF-D cells.

The primary objective of this work was to determine the phytochemical composition of the ethanolic extract derived from Prosopis juliflora leaves, as well as to assess its antibacterial and cytotoxic properties. The phytochemical screening using GC-MS revealed the presence of phytosteroids, ketone, esters, diisooctyl phthalate, and triterpenes. Besides, varying amounts of some silicon derivatives, which were reported to have antimicrobial activity, were detected with octasiloxane, which showed the highest amount (18.47%). 6-Ethoxy-6-methyl-2-cyclohexenone (antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiobesity, and antimicrobial) was detected in considerable quantity. Cytotoxic activity was seen in human breast cancer (MCF-7), human ovary adenocarcinoma (A2780), and human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, as well as in normal human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), when subjected to the MTT assay. The plant extract exhibited the highest level of activity (5.75 mu g/mL) against the A2780 cell line, with the MCF-7 cell line showing a somewhat lower level of activity (18.49 mu g/mL). The antibacterial effect of the plant extracts was evaluated against four standard Gram-positive and four standard Gram-negative. The antimicrobial potential was observed only against Staphylococcus aureus which recorded a 14.5 +/- 0.05 mm inhibition zone.

CWP exists as a fine powder on both young, upright, closed leaves (type A wax), and mature, pendant, open leaves (type B wax). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of extraction time on aqueous and ethanolic extracts of carnauba wax powder and quantify their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, we determined the total phenols, flavonoids, and flavonols in the extracts, and tested the effects of the extracts on the dermatophyte fungi Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum cans. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging effect of the extracts on 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2 '-dipheny1-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. Overall, higher extract yields were obtained using ethanol as a solvent, rather than water. All extracts showed antioxidant activity and the extraction time did not influence the antioxidant activity of the extracts; the strongest activity was observed for the ethanolic extract of type B wax powder (EtB) with an EC50 values of 365 +/- 7 mu g/mL (by DPPH assay) and 317 +/- 6 +/- g/mL (by ABTS).

This study intended to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of the methanolic root extract of Helleborus bocconei Ten. subsp. siculus, and of the bufadienolide and ecdysteroid fractions extracted from its roots, against strains belonging to species commonly associated with respiratory tract infections. Materials and methods: The phytochemical screening of the previously prepared plant extracts was carried out by chemical, thin-layer chromatography and spectroscopic methods. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the extracts against seven different standard bacterial strains was evaluated by broth microdilution. Results: According to the present study, Helleborus bocconei Ten. subsp. siculus roots contain bufadienolides and ecdysteroids, and the extracts containing these compounds, as well as the crude methanolic root extract, show antibacterial activity against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections. In particular, the bufadienolide extract has the highest inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms, and, as the other extracts, shows the lowest MIC values (100 mu g/ml) against Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Conclusions: Since the roots of Helleborus bocconei Ten. subsp. siculus contain substances with antibacterial activity, the traditional use of this plant may also derive from its antibacterial properties.

This encouraged us to initiate the current investigation to study the cytotoxic activity of A. vulgaris methanolic root extract against various cancer cell lines in vitro, along with its antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening. MTT assay was applied to test the cytotoxic effect against the prostate (PC-3), breast (MCF-7) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), together with normal Vero cells. Flow cytometry was employed to assess cell cycle arrest and apoptosis vs. necrosis in PC-3 cells. The expression of apoptosis-related genes (BAX, BCL2 and P53) was quantified by qRT-PCR analysis. The obtained results showed strong antiproliferative activity on the three cancer cell lines and the normal Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner. A high selectivity index (SI) was recorded against the three cell lines with PC-3 cells showing the highest SI and the lowest IC50. This effect was associated with cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and induction of total apoptosis at 27.18% being mainly early apoptosis. Apoptosis induction was related to the upregulation of the proapoptotic genes P53 and BAX and the downregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2. Additionally, the extract demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter johnsoni. Additionally, it showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Penicillium italicum and Fusarium oxysporium. Seven phenolic acids and seven flavonoids were detected.

In contrast, the study of the content of flavonoids will contribute to the expansion of pharmacological action and the use of the medicinal plant for medical purposes. The paper deals with the technology of extracts from Rh. tomentosum shoots using ethanol of various concentrations and purified water as an extractant. Extracts from Rh. tomentosum were obtained by a modified method that combined the effects of ultrasound and temperature to maximize the extraction of biologically active substances from the raw material. Using the method of high-performance thin-layer chromatography in a system with solvents ethyl acetate/formic acid/water (15:1:1), the following substances have been separated and identified in all the extracts obtained: rutin, hyperoside, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid. The total polyphenol content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were estimated using spectrophotometric methods involving the Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) reagent and the complexation reaction with aluminum chloride, respectively. A correlation analysis was conducted between antioxidant activity and the polyphenolic substance content. Following the DPPH assay, regression analysis shows that phenolic compounds contribute to about 80% (r2 = 0.8028, p < 0.05) of radical scavenging properties in the extract of Rh. tomentosum.

Previous studies reveal the biological activity of its phenolic constituents, making it very promising for the development of new medicines. Seasonality and geographic distribution of species can modify the production of secondary metabolites in Fabaceae species in terms of the preferentially activated metabolic pathways and, consequently, interfere with the medicinal properties of these species. Studying the influence of seasonality on the production of phenolic constituents is essential to establish conditions for cultivation, species collection, standardization, production, and safety in traditional medicine. This unprecedented study proposed to evaluate the influence of seasonal variations and habitat on the production of phenolic compounds and biological properties of the ethanolic extracts of the stem bark from L. ferrea , whose specimens were collected from the Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest, biomes of Brazil. Antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution. Cytotoxicity was evaluated through a colorimetric assay using MTT. ABTS and DPPH radical reduction methods estimated antioxidant capacities. Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl 3 spectrophotometric methods quantified total phenolics and flavonoids, respectively. In turn, radial diffusion quantified tannin content. PCA score plot and HCA dendogram were obtained by multivariate analysis of 1 H NMR data. The cytotoxicity against C6 glioma cells was observed only for Atlantic Forest extracts (EC 50 = 0.13-0.5 mg mL -1 ). These extracts also showed selectivity against Gram -positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) [MICs 500-2000 mu g mL -1 ], B . cereus CCT 0096) [MIC = 250 mu g mL -1 ], Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) [MICs = 250-500 mu g mL -1 ], S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228) [62.5-1000 mu g mL -1 ], mainly to Staphylococcus sp. Caatinga extracts showed higher production of flavonoids and antioxidants in the summer [7.36 +/- 0.19 mu g QE mg -1 extract; IC 50ABTS = 4.86 +/- 0.05 mu g mL -1 ], spring [5.96 +/- 0.10 mu g QE mg -1 extract; IC 50ABTS = 5.96 +/- 0.08 mu g mL -1 ], winter [4.89 +/- 0.25 mu g QE mg - 1 extract; IC 50ABTS = 6.72 +/- 0.08 mu g mL -1 ]. Regarding habitat, two discriminating compound patterns in the studied biomes were revealed by NMR. The results indicated that the Caatinga biome offers better conditions for activating the production of phenolics [336.34 +/- 18.1 mu gGAE mg -1 extract], tannins [328.38 +/- 30.19 mu gTAE mg -1 extract] in the summer and flavonoids in winter, spring, and summer. The extracts that showed the best antioxidant activities were also those from the Caatinga. In turn, extracts from the Atlantic Forest are more promising for discovering antibacterial compounds against Staphylococcus sp and cytotoxic for C6 glioma cells.

Yet, it is often used as animal feed or discarded in landfills, which is not the best eco-friendly way to utilize this phenolic-rich bioresource. Finding novel ways of utilizing pomegranate peel waste could prove a more profitable and eco-friendlier alternative that is far more beneficial to the economy. Adding a blanching pre-treatment step at optimal conditions prior to processing of pomegranate peel aids in the inactivation of quality changing enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), which are accountable for the degradation reactions that cause breakdown of nutrients and phytochemicals. This study aimed to determine the effect of blanching at 80 degrees C for 3 min on the yield, polyphenol content, antioxidant properties, enzyme inactivation, and antibacterial activity of 'Wonderful' pomegranate peel ethanolic extracts from three different harvest maturities (unripe, ripe, and over ripe), including a comprehensive characterization and quantification using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

There was significant (p < 0.05) decrease in PPO and POD activity of all blanched pomegranate peel extracts. The blanched unripe peel extracts had the lowest PPO activity at 0.2 U/g fresh weight (FW), with a 70% PPO inactivation compared to ripe and over ripe harvest, whereas the highest POD inactivation was recorded at 67% in over ripe peel extracts. All blanched peel extracts, irrespective of harvest maturity, had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values at 160 mu g/mL against all four bacteria strains tested, which included two Gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli 11775 and Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 13883). A total of 25 metabolites including phenolic acids (4), organic acids (1), flavonoids (4), ellagitannins (13), and other polyphenols (3) in all three pomegranate peel samples were tentatively identified after LC-MS profiling.

The total methanolic extracts of seeds and pericarps were prepared and their anti-bacterial activity was assessed using the agar diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was then calculated as compared to tigecycline. Then, an in-vivo murine model was established which confirmed the promising activity of M. koenigii seeds in demonstrating anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory actions. The histopathological study of lungs, scoring of pulmonary lesions, counting of bacterial loads after infection by multi-drug resistant A. baumannii all provided evidence to support these findings. LC-MS/MS profiling coupled to molecular networking and chemometrics detected the presence of carbazole alkaloids, and coumarins as dominate metabolites of the active seed extracts. Positively correlated metabolites to antibacterial potential were 6-(2',3' -dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-8-prenylumbelliferone, scopoline, and 5-methoxymurrayatin.

The chemical composition analysis and antioxidant activity of ABR extracts were performed by commonly used assays. Antibacterial activities of ABR extracts were tested against three gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria using disk diffusion and microdilution methods. The inhibition potential of the extract was adopted for urease and esterases. The extraction yield (27.10%), total phenolic (47.53 mg gallic acid equivalent/g), and flavonoid (9.74 mg quercetin equivalent/g) content of ABRME were found higher than other extracts. Vanillic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and protocatechuic acid were recognized as major components. ABRET, ABRHE, and ABREA extracts had a more effective total antioxidant activity than that of other extracts. The lipid peroxidation inhibition, H2O2, and superoxide scavenging activities of ABRME were found to be 35.94, 35.94, and 3.98 mu g/mL, respectively. The ABRET exhibited a reduction force with the A(0.5) values of 48.77 mu g/mL. The inhibition levels of ABRAC and ABREA to esterases were determined to be more effective than galantamine. ABRME was identified as a more potent urease inhibitor (IC50: 188.42 mu g/mL) than thiourea. ABRET demonstrated the antibacterial activity with the highest inhibition zone of 14.4 mm against Staphylococcus aureus. The ABRET found the lowest MIC value against Bacillus cereus (128 mu g/mL).

Moreover, herpes viral lesions can be complicated by inflammation and secondary bacterial infections. The development of resistance to antiviral drugs along with the undesirable side effects of these drugs are relevant argue for the development of new anti-HSV drugs with diverse mechanisms of action. Eucalyptus extracts have been used for decades to combat various infectious diseases. We isolated and studied 12 pure compounds and one mixture of two constitutional isomers from the leaves and twigs of E. globulus. The structures were identified by spectroscopic methods (NMR, HR-MS, IR) and all of them were tested for antiherpetic activity against the replication of antigen types HSV-1 and HSV-2. Tereticornate A (12) (IC50: 0.96 mu g/mL; selectivity index CC50/IC50: 218.8) showed the strongest activity in the anti-HSV-1 assay, even greater than acyclovir (IC50: 1.92 mu g/mL; selectivity index CC50/IC50: 109.4), a standard antiviral drug. Cypellocarpin C (5) (EC50: 0.73 mu g/mL; selectivity index CC50/EC50: 287.7) showed the most potent anti-HSV-2 activity, also more intensive than acyclovir (EC50: 1.75 mu g/mL; selectivity index CC50/EC50: 120.0).

In this investigation, for the proper analysis of the phenolic compounds present in plant tissues, it is essential to understand how solvent concentration and type affect the extraction process. Three different extraction solvents such as acetone, ethanol, and methanol were used at different concentrations ranging from 20% to 100% each to assess both the total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) present in each extract of C. citratus. Antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as two different types of fungus, was evaluated using the disc diffusion method. The stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical was used as a proxy for antioxidant capacity. The antimicrobial activity results showed that the acetone 60% extract was most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IZ = 17 mm), while the acetone 80% extract was more effective against S. cerevisiae (IZ = 18 mm). When tested against Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the highest effective antifungal activity was found in the 80% acetone and 80% methanol extracts, respectively. The highest DPPH-RSA IC50 value reported was 19.22 for ethanol at 60% concentration which is correlated mainly to its greatest total flavonoid content (58.7 mg QE/100 g) in addition to (300.1 mg GAE/100 g) as a TPC followed by acetone (80%) with IC50 value 21.16.

In this work, hydroethanolic extracts of J. regia leaves were obtained by heat assisted extraction from different Portuguese samples in two phenological stages (green and yellow leaves) aiming to assess the impact of seasonal variations. The samples were compared regarding their phenolic composition and bioactivity. Seventeen phenolic compounds were identified by liquid chromatography combined with a diode array detector and electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LC-DAD-ESI/MSn): six phenolic acids, ten flavonoids and one tetralone derivative. The green leaves extracts presented a higher amount of total phenolic compounds (29.70 +/- 0.03 mg/g extract) compared with the yellow leaves (23.26 +/- 0.06 mg/g extract). In particular, yellow samples were richer in flavonoids (17.4 +/- 0.2 mg/g extract; mainly quercetin-3-O-glucoside: 3.64 +/- 0.01 mg/g extract), while the green ones presented higher phenolic acids content (16.7 +/- 0.2 mg/g extract; mainly trans 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid: 6.9 +/- 0.5 mg/g extract). Green leaves extract also presented higher antioxidant potential, achieving IC50 values around 32 +/- 2 mu g/mL and 26.8 +/- 0.2 mu g/mL for the oxidative haemolysis inhibition and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assays, respectively. Furthermore, only green leaves samples showed anti-inflammatory potential. The cytotoxic evaluations revealed similar anti-proliferative action of both extracts against the tumor cell lines tested. Also, an analogous anti-bacterial potential of the extracts was observed, with preferential action against Gram-positive clinical isolated bacteria, with lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC = 2.5 mg/mL).

Moreover, there is a great need for the introduction of new, environmentally friendly technologies, including the extraction of antimicrobial substances. Supercritical fluid extraction is becoming an increasingly popular method for the recovery of bioactive compounds, representing a non-toxic, cheap, and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) technique, compared to conventional extraction methods, which often require higher temperatures and large amounts of organic solvents. The research presented here is the first to describe the biological activity of Glechoma hederacea extracts obtained by means of supercritical fluid extraction. Therefore, it provides new information and broadens the existing knowledge in the study of the properties of SC-CO2 plant extracts and their potential application. Glechoma hederacea var. longituba is a herbaceous plant from the Lamiaceae family, used in herbal medicine. In this work, we aimed to assess the total phenolic content, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of extracts obtained from G. hederacea via supercritical dioxide extraction with methanol as a co-solvent under different extraction conditions. The results showed that the activity of the obtained SC-CO2 extracts is strongly dependent on the extraction temperature. Significantly higher total polyphenol content, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activity towards bacteria and yeasts, was observed in the extract obtained at 40 degrees C, compared to extracts obtained at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C; however, antifungal activity against filamentous fungi was not dependent on the extraction conditions. Antimicrobial activity also depended on the microorganism type. Higher sensitivity was exhibited by Gram-positive bacteria than by Gram-negative bacteria, with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa being the most sensitive species among each group. The most susceptible fungi were Candida albicans and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The antibiofilm activity was differentiated and depended on the extraction conditions, the microorganism and the method of biofilm treatment. All tested extracts inhibited biofilm formation, with the extract obtained at 40 degrees C showing the highest value, whereas only extract obtained at 60 degrees C efficiently removed mature biofilm.",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,MDPI,antioxidant activity; antimicrobial properties; biofilm; Glechoma hederacea; plant extracts; supercritical fluid extraction,PLANT-EXTRACTS; SOLVENT EXTRACTS; PHENOLIC CONTENT; ESSENTIAL OIL; FRACTIONS; L.; MYCOTOXINS; PATHOGENS; CAPACITY,"[Gwiazdowska, Daniela; Frak, Szymon; Jus, Krzysztof; Marchwinska, Katarzyna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Inst Qual Sci, Dept Nat Sci & Qual Assurance, Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland; [Uwineza, Pascaline Aimee; Waskiewicz, Agnieszka] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Chem, Wojska Polskiego 75, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Gwiazdowski, Romuald] Natl Res Inst, Inst Plant Protect, Res Ctr Registrat Agrochem, Wladyslawa Wegorka 20, PL-60318 Poznan, Poland",Glechoma hederacea,,Lamiaceae,,"phenolics, phenolics","phenolics, phenolics",,,"Candida albicans, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum",Glechoma hederacea,Lamiaceae,Glechoma,Poland

To achieve this goal, the chemical composition was identified using an HPLC-DAD examination. The contents of polyphenols were assessed, while the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the DPPH test, and the reducing power test (RP) were utilized to determine antioxidant capacity. To assess the antibacterial activity, the microdilution technique was carried out to calculate the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of extracts against four nosocomial bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus). Additionally, the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of all tested extracts were examined in silico against the proteins NADPH oxidase and Bacillus cereus phospholipase C. Study reveals that M. longifolia extracts contain high phenolic and flavonoids. Additionally, the hydroethanolic extract contained the highest amounts of phenolic and flavonoid content, with values of 23.52 +/- 0.14 mg Gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight and 17.62 +/- 0.36 mg Quercetin Equivalent/g dry weight, respectively compared to the other two extracts. The same extract showed the best antioxidant capacity (IC50 = 39 mu g/mL +/- 0.00), and the higher RP (EC50 of 0.261 +/- 0.00 mg/mL), compared to the acetonic and aqueous extract regarding these tests. Furthermore, the hydroethanolic and acetonic extracts expressed the highest TAC (74.40 +/-; 1.34, and 52.40 +/- 0.20 mg EAA/g DW respectively), compared with the aqueous extract. Regarding antibacterial activity, the MIC value ranges between 1.17 and 12.50 mg/mL.

The samples of fresh, sun dried and shade dried persimmon were taken to examine the antioxidant activity of their peels and pulps. Four organic solvents system was used for extraction. The crude extract yields from the persimmon samples ranged from 11.1 to 84.8% of dry weight of pulp and 17.91 to 62.9% for peel. The 80% methanol showed highest extract yield. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), total flavonoids contents (TFCs), DPPH radical scavenging and reducing power assay were used for determination of antioxidant activity. Bacterial activity was done by disc diffusion method against four bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi. Individual phenolic acids were analysed by HPLC. TPCs and TFCs values for peel and pulp extract varied from 31.8-43.08 GAE mg/g DW, 22.3-35 GAE mg/g DW and 16.31-27.29 CE mg/g DW, 13.36-17.9 CE mg/g DW, respectively. The persimmon peel and pulp exhibited good DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing potential with contribution of IC50 0.63-2.09, 1.08-2.55 mg/ml and EC50 6893.20-12476.71 and 15723.10-21161.20 mg/ml of extract, respectively. Total amount of individual phenolic acids in persimmon extracts varied 20.9-553.15 mg/kg of extract. Gallic acid was the most prevalent phenolic in extracts. Fresh pulp extract possessed maximum value of total phenolic acids (553.15 mg/kg). Generally, present results revealed that extract of fresh persimmon peel has highest antioxidant activity than pulp. Fresh persimmon possessed greater antioxidant potential than dried persimmon. The persimmon extracts exhibited the good antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial strains. With regard to different aqueous organic solvents used 80% methanol was found to be most effective solvent for the extraction of bioactive compounds.

Aqueous and ethanolic extract showed total phenolic content of 207.5 +/- 0.16 and 268.4 +/- 0.42 GAE/mg, respectively. Likewise, total flavonoid content of 50.12 +/- 0.39 and 192.88 +/- 0.27 QE/mg was estimated for the aqueous and ethanolic extract, respectively. In vitro antibacterial, antioxidant, alpha-amylase inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer attributes of extracts were assessed using standard protocols. The antibacterial traits of both the extracts were assessed against certain pathogenic bacteria which exhibited maximum zone of inhibition of 22.3 +/- 0.6 mm against Staphylococcus aureus. Antioxidant tests showed not only significant scavenging of DPPH, superoxide, hydroxyl, and ABTS(center dot+) radicals but also estimated ferric reducing power and phosphomolybdenum reduction activities of extracts in a concentration dependent manner. The aqueous extract (54.12 +/- 0.44-86.80 +/- 0.27%) depicted higher rate of alpha-amylase inhibition than ethanolic extract (23.07 +/- 0.47-81.61 +/- 0.43%) at distinct concentrations. Similarly, the aqueous extract protected the haemolysis (46.19 +/- 0.14-66.21 +/- 0.17%) effectively as compared to the ethanolic extract (12.67 +/- 0.19-38.03 +/- 0.41%).

Recently, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella sp. has caused more serious problems in public health. The present study investigated the antibacterial effects of Houttuynia cordata water extract (HCWE) against murine salmonellosis. In RAW 264.7 cells, there was no detectable cytotoxic effect of HCWE at any concentration between 25 and 100 mu g/ml after 8-h incubation. The antibacterial activity of HCWE was then examined in a Salmonella enterica serovar (Salmonella typhimurium), and was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 25 to 100 mu g/ml during 8-h incubation. HCWE also affected RAW 264.7 cells including morphologic change and bacterial uptake, but there was no significant difference in bacterial replication in RAW 264.7 cells. With HCWE alone, nitric oxide (NO) production by RAW 264.7 cells did not increase, but when RAW 264.7 cells were infected by S. typhimurium, with or without HCWE, NO production with HCWE was 2-fold higher than that without HCWE. Treatment with HCWE did not affect inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by RAW 264.7 cells, but when RAW 264.7 cells with HCWE were infected by S. typhimurium, iNOS mRNA expression was increased during 8-h incubation. Furthermore, HCWE showed virulence reduction effects in S. typhimurium-infected BALB/c mice. After a lethal dose of S. typhimurium, the mortality rate in the HCWE untreated group was 100% at 7 d, but the HCWE 25, 50, and 100 mu g/ml groups survived until 11, 17, and 23 d, respectively.

Date seeds are the main by-product of date fruit consumption and processing. Date seeds are usually incorporated in animal feed; however, their application in human contexts, such as food products, remains minimal. Nonetheless, they contain significant amounts of bioactive phenolic compounds, primarily flavonoids, which possess potential health benefits. The current study investigated and compared the phenolic profile, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of aqueous extracts of nine different date seeds varieties. The phenolic profile, analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS), showed that total phenolic compounds ranged from 1.05 to 1.24 mg/g in Reziz and Naghal varieties, respectively, with flavan-3-ols predominating in all varieties. Results of the ABTS and DPPH assays revealed that the antioxidant activities against free radicals were directly correlated with the overall phenolic content, particularly for caffeic acid.

Phy- tochemical profiling revealed the presence of a higher amount of total phenolic (271.44 +/- 4.41 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid contents (216.47 +/- 5.82 mg QE/g) in methanolic extract (MEAJ), and as compared to n-hexane fraction (HEAJ) and stronger biological activities of MEAJ were possibly linked to the higher bioactive contents. The freshly collected plant leaves showed a strong antiox-idant potential (total antioxidant capacity 1.03 +/- 0.19 mmol TE/g), which was found even stronger in dried methanolic extract (TAC; 4.36 +/- 1.12 mmol TE/g), moreover, MEAJ also showed strong antioxidant potential when investigated by different antioxidant assays (DPPH; 154.04 +/- 2.47, ABTS; 122.36 +/- 0.80, FRAP; 453.18 +/- 5.9, CUPRAC; 1389.97 +/- 5.32 mg TE/g). The MEAJ showed good tyrosinase inhibition activity (71.69 %), compared with 83 % inhibition by kojic acid. Ten major compounds identified by GC-MS were docked and eight legends showed lower binding energies (-6 to-7.8 kcal/mol) compared with kojic acid (-5.9 kcal/mol), which shows the possible role of these compounds in the anti-tyrosinase activity of the extract, and the ADMET analysis predicted the drug-likeness and safety profile of the studied compounds. The thrombolytic effect of MEAJ was 56.41 +/- 0.75 to 57.15 +/- 1.41 % which was comparable with streptokinase (82.44 +/- 1.15 to 84.14 +/- 0.95 %). Antibacterial activity of MEAJ was also good (MEAJ; 0.5-2.0 mg/mL, and co-amoxiclav; 5.0-12.5 mg/mL), and the highest activity was observed against Bacillus subtilis (MEAJ; 0.5 mg/mL, co-amoxiclav; 5.0 mg/mL). The antiviral activity of MEAJ was highly strong (HA titer; 00 to 08) against all the tested strains. It can be concluded that A. jacque-montii is a prospective source of phytochemicals with strong biological activities, and their usage in formulations of natural products and pharmaceuticals is recommended, however, further research may address the discovery and development of novel drugs for the pharmaceutical industry.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The present study aims to investigate the presence of phytochemicals, antioxidant properties, antibacterial activities and wound healing potential of methanolic extracts of the leaves, fruits, flowers and bark of Dillenia excelsa. Phytochemical screening using frothing test, Salkowski test, Dragendorff's test and ferric chloride test revealed the presence of saponins, steroids, terpenoids, alkaloids and tannins. The total phenolic content (TPC) investigated using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and total flavonoid contents (TFC) assessed using aluminium chloride colorimetric assay yielded the highest value of 106.3 +/- 2.6 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram (GAE/g) of crude leaves extract and 23.1 +/- 0.5 mg quercetin equivalent per gram (QE/g) of crude leaves extract, respectively. The antioxidant capacities of the extracts were assessed and showed the leaves extract has the highest 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power with the value of 156.2 +/- 59.3 mg GAE/g of crude extract and 2.77 +/- 0.33 mg Trolox equivalent per gram (TE/g) of crude extract, respectively. Antibacterial activities against two gram-positive and two gram-negative strains using agar well diffusion method revealed only the flowers extract showed inhibition against Bacillus subtilis with minimum inhibitory concentration of 40 mg/mL. The in vivo wound healing potential was also carried out using male Wistar rats. The high dose leaves extract (50% w/w) showed the highest reduction in wound size at day 7, 10 and day 14 compared to the control groups and other treatment groups.

In addition, the phenolic profiles of the studied plant extracts and antibacterial activity have been investigated. The extracts from C. incanus and G. urbanum demonstrated the highest TPC and antioxidant capacity, while the extracts from A. archangelica and white mulberry were characterized by the lowest values. A remarkable correlation was also found between the TPC and antioxidant activity of the examined extracts. HPLC analysis showed that the studied extracts were sources of both phenolic acids and flavonoids. More flavonoids than phenolic acids were identified in the extracts of C. incanus, M. alba, R. idaeus and B. pendula compared to the other extracts tested.

As opposed to the weak antiradical activity estimated by DPPH and ABTS tests, the essential oil caused inhibition of all the bacteria following well-diffusion and microdilution methods, especially the gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. It displayed exceptionally remarkable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by totally inhibiting its growth on the agar plate exceeding the effect of chloramphenicol standard. This bactericidal effect was confirmed by very low MIC and MBC values of 0.82 and 6.562 mu g/mL, respectively.

The use of phytopharmaceuticals and herbal medicines has a positive impact and represents a promising alternative. Psidium guajava extracts have been widely reported to have antimicrobial potential; however, studies reporting their activity against resistant bacterial strains are scarce. Because of the emerging resistance, the aim of this study was to analyze the antimicrobial capacity of the aqueous extract of guava leaves against wild-type and resistant bacterial strains. The aqueous extract obtained from the leaves of P. guajava was evaluated by HPLC for the content of total phenolics and tannins, antioxidant activity, and chemical composition. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was analyzed by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The results of the chemical analysis of the extracts showed total phenolics content of 17.02 & PLUSMN; 6.87 mg/g of dry extract, total tannin content of 14.09 & PLUSMN; 1.20 mg of tannic acid equivalents/g of dry extract, and moderate antioxidant capacity with an EC50 value of 140 & mu;g/mL. Flavonoids are the major compounds (rutin, hesperidin, and quercetin), followed by phenolic acids. Disk diffusion test results showed the presence of inhibition halos for Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, sensitive and resistant; Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, sensitive and resistant; and Streptococcus spp., beta-hemolytic), while for Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, sensitive and resistant), there was no inhibition in the tested concentration range. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration was 6.8 mg/mL for all Gram-positive strains evaluated. The present study demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of the aqueous extract of P. guajava against sensitive and resistant Gram-positive bacteria. The better antimicrobial activity found in the present study compared with previously reported activity should be highlighted and may be related to the higher concentration of total phenolics present in the tested extract. Moreover, the content of tannins found suggests a species with high quality that produces tannins. These new findings suggest an innovative profile regarding therapeutic resources that can be adopted to combat resistant microbial strains.",MICROORGANISMS,MDPI,phytopharmaceuticals; Psidium guajava; antimicrobial resistance; phenolics; antioxidant,ANTIOXIDANT; L.; LEAVES,"[Pereira, Geraldo Augusto; Monsores e Silva, Taynara; Patricio, Thereza Cristina da Costa; Fernandes, Anna Julia Bessa; Coelho, Shana de Mattos de Oliveira; Cid, Yara Peluso] Fed Rural Univ Rio Janeiro, Vet Inst, Pos Grad Program Vet Sci, BR 465,Km 7, BR-23897000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Chaves, Douglas Siqueira de Almeida; Motta, Raissa Emidio de Araujo; da Silva, Adriana Barbosa Rocha; Cid, Yara Peluso] Fed Rural Univ Rio Janeiro, Hlth & Biol Sci Inst, Pharmaceut Sci Dept, BR 465,Km 7, BR-23897000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Coelho, Shana de Mattos de Oliveira] Fed Rural Univ Rio Janeiro, Vet Inst, Vet Microbiol & Immunol Dept, BR 465,Km 7, BR-23897000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Ozarowski, Marcin] Inst Nat Fibres & Med Plants, Dept Biotechnol, Wojska Polskiego 71b, PL-60630 Poznan, Poland; [Karpinski, Tomasz M.] Poznan Univ Med Sci, Chair & Dept Med Microbiol, Rokietnicka 10, PL-60806 Poznan, Poland",Psidium guajava,,Myrtaceae,,"phenolics, tannins, tannins, flavonoids, phenolics","phenolics, tannins, tannins, flavonoids, phenolics","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Psidium guajava,Myrtaceae,Psidium,Brazil

(Ranunculaceae), commonly known as 'black cumin', is an erect herbaceous annual plant. N. sativa seeds have traditionally been used in folk medicine as a natural remedy for various diseases as well as a spice. The seeds contain both fixed and essential oils, proteins, alkaloids and saponins. Much of the biological activity of the seeds has been shown to be due to thymoquinone, the major component of the essential oil. The fixed oil is composed mainly of unsaturated fatty acids, including the unusual C20:2 eicosadienoic acid. Isolation of volatile and fixed oils from N. salvia seed of Turkey and Egypt has been obtained by super-critical fractioned extraction with carbon dioxide. Extraction experiments were carried out at pressures of 90 and 300 bar and temperature of 40 degrees C. The extraction step performed at 90 bar produced a volatile fraction mainly formed by tymoquinone (79 divided by 86%) and o-cymene (5 divided by 11%). The oil yield relative to this step of the process was 0.1 divided by 0.3% by weight of the charge. The last extraction step at 300 bar produced a fixed oil. The yield of this step was 21-26% by weight. The most represented fatty acids of fixed oil from N. sativa were 18:2 n - 6 (54 divided by 55%), 18:1 n - 9 (22 divided by 23%), 16:0 (12 divided by 13%), 18:0(3%), and 20:2(2 divided by 3%). The volatile and fixed oils obtained from N. sativa were evaluated for the antibacterial activity by employing standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Acinetobacer baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus,Enterococcus faecalis. In vitro anti fungal activity of the derivatives against Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei were screened by using ketoconazole, and fluconazole as control agents. The anti-mycobacterium activity breakpoint concentration (mu g mL(-1)) was determined against standard strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and M. avium (ATCC 15769). The volatile and fixed oils displayed antimicrobial activity toward all of the standard (ATCC, RSKK) strains of the tested bacteria at MIC values of 8-64 mu g mL(-1) and were revealed to be ineffective against isolated strains (MIC; >256 mu g mL(-1)). The volatile and fixed oils emerged as effective against the bacteria of M. avium with MIC values of 8 mu g mL(-1). Moreover, all the extracts exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei at MIC values of 16-64 mu g mL(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Among other uses, it has been applied against dermatitis and eczema often worsened by staphylococcal colonization of the skin. Aim of the study: The study was conducted to evaluate applicability of N. sativa seed extract in antibacterial skin formulations by examination of its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts. Materials and methods: Two variants of N. sativa seed extract containing 9.91 and 2.10 % of thymoquinone were prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The extracts and standards of their major volatile ingredients; thymoquinone, thymol, p-cymene alongside with the reference antiseptics; chlorquinaldol and a combination of amylmetacresol with 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol were subjected to evaluation of antibacterial efficacy against a collection of Staphylococcus aureus strains. The preparation based on Vaseline containing 1% of N. sativa extract was applied on Mueller-Hinton agar plates and its ability to inhibit S. aureus growth was examined. The MTT assay was employed to study cytotoxic effects of the thymoquinone-rich N. sativa seed extract against HDFa fibroblasts. Results: N. sativa seed extract and thymoquinone have shown potent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) isolated in Poland. Results suggest that N. sativa seed extract activity against S. aureus should mainly be attributed to thymoquinone, which was effective in concentrations of 4-16 mu g/ml. Regarding the activity against S. aureus, thymoquinone was more efficient than a combination of amylmetacresol with 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and comparable to chlorquinaldol. The Vaseline-based preparation containing N. sativa extract caused growth inhibition comparable to an equally concentrated DMSO solution of the extract. The IC50 of N. sativa extract against HDFa fibroblast was determined at 0.2 mg/ml, which was 2-fold higher than the average MIC and MBC of the extract against S. aureus.

Thus, the aim of this study was to enhance the antimicrobial and antifungal activities of a pigmented extract obtained from G. globosa flowers by ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE). The procedure was supported with the application of the response surface methodology, a robust optimization technique that allows to study jointly the effects of several variables and responses. To enhance the antimicrobial (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and antifungal (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium ochrochloron and Penicillium verrucosum) activities, the responses were evaluated in terms of the concentrations needed to obtain minimum inhibitory (MIC), minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum fungicidal (MFC) concentrations. It was found that the optimal UAE conditions were 10.8 min, 410.5 W, 57.8% of ethanol, and 5 g L-1 of the solid-liquid ratio providing the following response values: (1) from the studied species of bacteria, the MIC ranged from approximate to 0.15 to 0.35 g L-1 and the MBC ranges were approximate to 0.30 to 0.65 g L-1; and (2) from the studied fungus species, the MIC ranged from approximate to 0.20 to 0.30 g L-1 and the MFC ranges were approximate to 0.40 to 0.65 g L-1. The antibacterial activity dose levels were lower than the antifungal ones.

Leaf Extract,"Genus Carissa represents several species that are reported to be of great phyto-medicinal and ethnopharmacological value. However, Carissa macrocarpa is relatively understudied. Furthermore, environmental conditions such as seasonal changes are known to affect the phytochemical composition of medicinal plants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the phytochemical composition and biological activity of the leaf extracts of C. macrocarpa in the summer and winter seasons. The phytochemical screening of C. macrocarpa leaves showed positive results for a variety of phytochemicals, such as alkaloids, tannins, phenols, naphthoquinones, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, proteins, carbohydrates, mucilage, gum and resin. The methanolic extract was evaluated for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using the agar well diffusion method. The winter leaf extract was distinguished for its potential antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains with inhibition zones (mm) of 8.17 +/- 1.04 and 6.83 +/- 0.58 at 10 mg/mL. The antioxidant activity of the leaf extracts was evaluated using the 2, 2 '-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The percentage scavenging activities of the different extracts were significantly greater than that of the control. Furthermore, at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 mu g/mL, the percentage scavenging activities of the winter methanol leaf extract were 74.65, 78.31, 85.45, 90.02 and 95.68%, and those of the summer one were 71.66, 73.57, 84.05, 88.22 and 96.28%, respectively, indicating that the methanol leaf extract had greater percentage scavenging activity in winter than in summer. In winter, the IC50 value of the methanol leaf extract (0.67 mu g/mL) was lower than that of ascorbic acid (8.26 mu g/mL). It is concluded that winter is the optimal season to harvest leaves of C. macrocarpa for medicinal use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that relates the phytochemical composition and medicinal properties of C. macrocarpa to changes in seasons.

The curry leaves, Murraya koenigii, and Micromelum minutum are two most common aromatic herbs widespread in Sri Lanka and many other Asian countries. They are rich in nutrition and exert several medicinal properties such as antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic due to various essential phytochemicals, minerals, and trace minerals. In this study, we determined the proximate composition, in vitro antioxidant activity, total phenol (TPC), flavonoid content (TFC), and antibacterial activity in both species using standard methods. Results showed that both species varied greatly in nutritional composition, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. The nutrient composition in terms of ash, crude protein, and fat was significantly high in M. koenigii based on dry weight basis. In vitro antioxidant potential of M. koenigii and M. minutum was evaluated by means of the DPPH radical scavenging assay, and the IC50 values of M. koenigii and M. minutum were 107 +/- 2 mu g/mL and 208 +/- 4 mu g/mL, respectively.

Methods: Total flavonoids and total phenolics content from the leaf, stem, and rhizome of Z. zerumbet at 3 different growth stages (3, 6, and 9 months) were determined using spectrophotometric methods and individual flavonoid and phenolic compounds were identified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method. Chalcone Synthase (CHS) activity was measured using a CHS assay. Antioxidant activities were evaluated by ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. The antibacterial activity was determined against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the disc diffusion method. Results: Highest content of total flavonoid [29.7 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g dry material (DM)] and total phenolic (44.8 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g DM) were detected in the rhizome extracts of 9-month-old plants. As the plant matured from 3 to 9 months, the total flavonoid content (TFC) and total phenolic content (TPC) decreased in the leaf, but increased significantly in the rhizomes. Among the secondary metabolites identified, the most abundant, based on the concentrations, were as follows: flavonoids, catechin > quercetin > rutin > luteolin > myricetin > kaempferol; phenolic acids, gallic acid > ferulic acid > caffeic acid > cinnamic acid. Rhizome extracts from 9-month-old plants demonstrated the highest CHS activity (7.48 nkat/mg protein), followed by the 6-month-old rhizomes (5.79 nkat/mg protein) and 3-month-old leaf (4.76 nkat/mg protein). Nine-month-old rhizomes exhibited the highest DPPH activity (76.42 %), followed by the 6-month-old rhizomes (59.41 %) and 3-month-old leaves (57.82 %), with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 55.8, 86.4, and 98.5 mu g/mL, respectively, compared to that of alpha-tocopherol (84.19 %; 44.8 mu g/mL) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (70.25 %; 58.6 mu g/mL). The highest FRAP activity was observed in 9-month-old rhizomes, with IC50 of 62.4 mu g/mL. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Z. zerumbet extracts against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 30 to > 100 mu g/mL. Among the bacterial strains examined, Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to the leaf extract of Z. zerumbet, with MIC of 30.0 mu g/mL and other strains were sensitive to the rhizome extracts.

During aging, polyphenols are transferred from the barrels to the liquid. Although the bioactivity of oak polyphenols in wines has been extensively studied, no investigation exists on their toxicological properties, which limits their use as functional safe ingredients for other products. In this work, the chemical composition of a polyphenolic extract of Quercus crassifolia bark (QCBe) was studied by GC-MS. Its antibacterial properties on probiotic and pathogenic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity were determined as a way to understand the potential impact from its addition to fermented food as a functional ingredient. QCBe shows a selective inhibition of Escherichia coli compared with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus. According to the toxicity evaluation, the subacute no-observed-adverse-effect-level was achieved at 11 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the subacute lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level for kidney damage was at 33 mg/kg bw/day. These results suggest that, given the fact an adverse effect was observed after subacute administration of this extract, further longer term toxicological studies are needed to provide sufficient safety evidence for its use in humans. Practical ApplicationMexico's yogurt market is growing which creates opportunities for the development of some yogurt products as functional foods. As a first step to evaluate its potential use in yogurt formulation, the antibacterial effect of aQuercus crassifolia polyphenolic extract (QCBe)on probiotic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity in rats were studied. A low inhibition on probiotic bacteria growth was observed after QCBe addition to Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus cultures. Exposure to QCBe for a subacute duration resulted in renal injury in rats at dosages greater than or equal to 33 mg/kg/bw/day. This adverse effect indicates the importance of performing further long-term toxicological assessments prior to the addition of QCBe to a food like yogurt, which is regularly eaten by consumers.",JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE,WILEY,antibacterial; polyphenols; Quercus crassifolia; toxicity,TEA POLYPHENOLS; ANTIOXIDANT; WINE; WOOD; BIOAVAILABILITY; NEPHROTOXICITY; BENEFITS; TANNINS; ACIDS,"[Valencia-Aviles, Erendira] Univ Michoacana, Programa Inst, Morelia 58004, Michoacan, Mexico; [Valencia-Aviles, Erendira] Univ Michoacana, Ciencias Biol, Morelia 58004, Michoacan, Mexico; [Martinez-Flores, Hector-Eduardo] Univ Michoacana, Fac Quim Farmacobiol, Morelia 58240, Michoacan, Mexico; [Garcia-Perez, Manuel] Washington State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Pullman, WA 99164 United States of America; [Melendez-Herrera, Esperanza] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Recursos Nat, Morelia 58330, Michoacan, Mexico; [Garcia-Perez, Martha-Estrella] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Quim Biol, Morelia 58030, Michoacan, Mexico",Quercus crassifolia,,Fagaceae,,"phenolics, phenolics","phenolics, phenolics",Escherichia coli,negative,,Quercus crassifolia,Fagaceae,Quercus,Mexico

(Hypericaceae), or St. John's Wort, is a well-known medicinal herb often associated with the treatment of anxiety and depression. Additionally, an oil macerate (Oleum Hyperici) of its flowering aerial parts is widely used in traditional medicine across the Balkans as a topical wound and ulcer salve. Other studies have shown that Oleum Hyperici reduces both wound size and healing time. Of its active constituents, the naphthodianthrone hypericin and phloroglucinol hyperforin are effective antibacterial compounds against various Gram-positive bacteria. However, hyperforin is unstable with light and heat, and thus should not be present in the light-aged oilmacerate. Additionally, hypericin can cause phototoxic skin reactions if ingested or absorbed into the skin. Therefore, the established chemistry presents a paradox for this H. perforatum oil macerate: the hyperforin responsible for the antibacterial bioactivity should degrade in the sunlight as the traditional oil is prepared; alternately, if hypericin is present in established bioactive levels, then the oil macerate should cause photosensitivity, yet none is reported. In this research, various extracts of H. perforatum were compared to traditional oil macerates with regards to chemical composition and antibacterial activity (inhibition of growth, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing) vs. several strains of Staphylococcus aureus in order to better understand this traditional medicine. It was found that four Kosovar-crafted oil macerates were effective at inhibiting biofilm formation (MBIC50 active range of 0.004-0.016% v/v), exhibited moderate inhibition of quorum sensing (QSIC(50) active range of 0.064-0.512% v/v), and contained detectable amounts of hyperforin, but not hypericin. Overall, levels of hypericin were much higher in the organic extracts, and these also exhibited more potent growth inhibitory activity. In conclusion, these data confirm that oil macerates employed in traditional treatments of skin infection lack the compound credited with phototoxic reactions in H. perforatum use and exhibit anti-biofilm and modest quorum quenching effects, rather than growth inhibitory properties against S. aureus.",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,Hypericum perforatum; Staphylococcus aureus; traditional medicine; phototoxicity,HYPERICUM-PERFORATUM L; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BIOFILM PRODUCTION; BACTERIAL-GROWTH; HYPERFORIN; EXTRACTS; CONSTITUENTS; PLANTS,"[Lyles, James T.; Kim, Austin; Quave, Cassandra L.] Emory Univ, Ctr Study Human Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 United States of America; [Nelson, Kate; Bullard-Roberts, Angelle L.; Quave, Cassandra L.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Atlanta, GA 30322 United States of America; [Hajdari, Avni; Mustafa, Behxhet] Univ Pristina, Dept Biol, Prishtine, Kosovo; [Quave, Cassandra L.] Emory Univ, Emory Antibiot Resistance Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 United States of America",perforatum,Hypericum perforatum,,Hypericaceae,noise,noise,Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Hypericum perforatum,Hypericaceae,Hypericum,United States

,"Lee, SC; Muhammad, SA; Ibrahim, MH; Nor, NMIM",2018,Antifungal properties of Mimusops elengi seeds against paddy seed-borne fungi and selected pathogenic fungi,"Aims: The ever-revolving fungi strains and environmental and health concerns due to current practice of synthetic pesticide in agricultural fields have encourages more ventures into bio-pesticides research. Mimusops elengi, a widely available endogenous plant in tropical countries and most parts of this plant have been proven to possess medicinal and antimicrobial potential. In this study, M. elengi seeds crude extracts are tested for their antifungal activities on paddy seed-borne and pathogenic fungi. Methodology and results: The dried and grinded M. elengi seeds are macerated separately using water, methanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and petroleum ether as extraction medium. Crude extract of each solvent was used on paddy seed surface treatment to determine their antifungal inhibition potential on seed-borne fungi and paddy grain germination. Synthetic fungicide mancozeb and thiram are also tested as comparisons to the performance of plant extracts. Water and methanol extracts exerted the best fungal inhibiting and grain germination results from the five crude extracts tested and qualitative phytochemical screening reveals both extracts contained the most number of phytoconstituents including saponin, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and phenolic. Water extract, methanol extracts and synthetic fungicides are then subjected to in-vitro bioassay to observe their effect on mycelial growth of several fungi strains pathogenic to paddy namely, Fusarium fujikuroi, Curvularia aeria, C. lunata and C. eragrostidis. Water and methanol extracts showed a very similar trend of inhibition on all four fungi strains tested with best percentage of inhibition on mycelia growth of C. eragrostidis followed by C. aeria, C. lunata and least effective on F. fujikuroi. Further separation of crude extract need to be done to isolate the specific acting compounds contributing to fungal growth inhibition. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Both water and methanol extracts of the seeds contain promising antifungal properties on seed borne fungi which is as good as the synthetic fungicides compared in this study. A broad range of active phytochemical properties it possesses may be the contributing factor for the fungal growth inhibition.

To evaluate in vitro the cytotoxic, antifungal and antimicrobial activities of this extract and the cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of its isolated secondary metabolites. Methods: The cytotoxic effects of the extract were investigated on 3 human cancer cell lines i.e. the A549 non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma and the U373 glioblastoma using a MTT colorimetric assay. Biological data allowed to guide the fractionation of the extract by separation and purification on silica gel 60 (CC and TLC). The isolated compounds which were characterized by spectral analysis, mainly HR-ESIMS, HR-EIMS, UV and NMR experiments (H-1, C-13, COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC) and comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature, were evaluated for cytotoxic activities on six cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, U373, Hs683 human glioma, PC3 human prostate and B16-F10 murine melanoma). The direct and indirect antibacterial and antifungal activities were determined using microdilution methods for the raw extract and TLC-bioautography and microdilution methods against standard and clinical strains for the isolated compounds. Results: The raw extract reduced cell viability with IC(50)s of 27, 25 and 21 mu g/mL on A549, MCF7 and U373, respectively. Five secondary metabolites: two phenolic compounds (vanillin 1, paridol 3), a lignan [(-)-arctigenin 2] and two flavonoid aglycones (eupatilin 4 and jaceosidin 5), were then isolated from this extract. Moderate cytotoxic effects were observed for (-)-arctigenin 2 (IC50s: 28 and 33 mu M on Hs683 and B16-F10, respectively), eupatilin 4 (IC50s: 33 and 47 mM on B16-F10 and PC3, respectively) and jaceosidin 5 (IC50s: 32 and 40 mM on PC3 and B16-F10, respectively). Conclusions: All the isolated compounds were described for the first time from this species. Although inactive against 7 tested microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and yeast, human or plant pathogens), the raw extract was able to potentiate the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), reducing the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by a factor of 2-32-fold.

Dietary sources are often entertained to improve the immune system of the body to fight against these infections. The date fruit (Phoenix dactylifera L) is one such functional food that is less explored for its actual potentials. Methods: The polyphenols isolated from the different cultivars of dates in Saudi Arabia (Ajwa, Safawi, Khalas, and Sukkary) was evaluated for their antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-biofilm forming abilities. The anti-radical properties of the phenolic extract were conducted in terms of the scavenging of diphenyl1-picrylhydrazyl radical, hydrogen peroxide radicals and ABTS radicals. The anti-inflammatory potential was analyzed in terms of lipoxygenase activity inhibition. Results: The phenolic compounds of different dates were spectrophotometrically estimated and cultivars such as Ajwa and Sukkary had the highest polyphenol content. It was also noteworthy that they exerted potent antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as estimated by the least minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) or minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Besides, these polyphenols reduced the biofilm formation by these bacterial pathogens; it is thus possible that the polyphenols from dates can be a promising antimicrobial agent against various pathogenic strains. Corroborating with these, the polyphenol extracts from different Saudi Arabian dates were found to inhibit the growth of mycelium in strains of Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Apart from these, the polyphenol isolates also exhibited significant anti-radical properties against different reactive radical systems. Conclusion: Overall, the efficacy of phenolic compounds extracted from the dried date fruits are not only restricted to the functional food features; instead, these molecules are capable of preventing the growth of microbial pathogens of humans. Hence, it may emerge as potent antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-biofilm forming candidates. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

However, there is little information related to activities of whole plant extracts. Aim: To investigate the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the ethanolic extract from whole plant of I. balsamina, I. hawkeri and I. walleriana. Methods: Whole plant material of each species was macerated with ethanol (80% v/v). Phytochemical screening was applied for detection of different metabolites. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride methods respectively. In vitro antioxidant properties were evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, potassium ferricyanide antioxidant reducing power (PFRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. In vitro antimicrobial activity of extracts was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29737), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus pneumoniae (clinical isolate), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16404) using microdilution assay for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assessment. Statistical Analysis Used: Results were expressed as mean +/- SD. Data obtained were analyzed statistically using ANOVA (one-way) followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson correlation test. Results: I. hawkeri extract showed the highest phenolic content (TPC: 44.04 mg GAE/g; TFC: 55, 02 mg QE/g) and was the most antioxidant extract. I. balsamina extract was the most active against all Gram positive bacteria (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/ml) tested and over C. albicans (MIC: 10 mg/ml).

Genotypes","Walnuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world because they are one of the best sources of beneficial nutrients, minerals, and antioxidants. They also contain key sources of energy. Despite several traditional uses, the leaves of Juglans regia L. have received little attention regarding phytochemical and pharmacological potential. Thus, the current study intended to find the walnut genotypes with the greatest antioxidant, anticancer, and antifungal activity. The total polyphenolic, flavonoid, and flavanol contents of leaves from 14 walnut genotypes were determined. Genotypes that accumulate flavonoid/flavonol contents (99.8-111.93 mg/g quercetin equivalent (QE) and 101.67-111.83 mg/g QE) showed significantly higher ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) activity (128.2-148.1 mu M Fe2+/g dry weight (DW)] than other genotypes. Maximum divergence in the quercetin content (0.8-1.23 mg/g) of walnut genotypes was obtained by cluster analysis. The active component, quercetin, was measured using RP-HPLC. Moreover, the extracts were investigated for antifungal and anticancer assays. We report the significant antifungal potential of walnut leaf genotypes against Candida glabrata, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis, with 57.7-93.6%, 26.8-51.5%, and 26.8-51.5% inhibition, respectively. The most significant antiproliferative effect was shown by Opex Culchry, which exhibited 9.4% cell viability at a concentration of 25 mu L (0.75 mg) against lung (A549) cell lines. Chenovo exhibited 2.9, 6.2, and 2.2% cell viability, Opex Culchry exhibited 2, 1.5, and 2.4% cell viability, and Sulieman showed 7.6, 0.9, and 7% cell viability against the colon (HCT116) cell lines.

In the present study, we examined whether red ginseng extract (RGE) exerts antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RGE had no bactericidal activity, at least in the range of dissolvable concentration. However, RGE reduced 0.03-0.25-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of beta-lactam antibiotics (oxacillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cefazolin) and aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin and gentamicin) against the two laboratory strains of MRSA. Moreover, the fractional inhibitory concentration index indicated the synergistic activity of RGE with each of the antibiotics. RGE also increased the kanamycin sensitivity of 15 MRSA strains isolated from human volunteers and increased the ampicillin sensitivity of five MRSA strains isolated from dairy cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis. In contrast, RGE did not alter the MIC values of fosfomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, suggesting that RGE acts selectively. In contrast, Triton X-100, which was reported to reduce the MIC value of beta-lactam antibiotics to MRSA by increasing membrane permeability, reduced the MIC values of fosfomycin and tetracycline. These results indicate that RGE increases the bactericidal effect of antibiotics via a mechanism different from that used by Triton X-100. We found that ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3), a component of RGE, was an essential compound that exhibits synergy activity with antibiotics. Furthermore, the non-natural compound K, which contains a common protopanaxadiol aglycon moiety with Rg3, also showed synergistic activity with antibiotics. Thus, Rg3 and compound K are potentially new antibiotic adjuvants against MRSA. IMPORTANCE Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant organism that is prevalent worldwide. Therefore, the research and development of new agents against MRSA are required. We first found that ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) in red ginseng, made from the roots of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, increased the sensitivity of beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycoside antibiotics to MRSA. Furthermore, we identified that compound K, an unnatural ginsenoside analog, also increased the sensitivity of antibiotics to MRSA, similar to Rg3. By contrast, neither Rg3 nor compound K increased the sensitivity of fosfomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin to MRSA, suggesting that these act selectively. In the present study, the natural compound Rg3 and its structural isomer, compound K, are potentially new antibiotic adjuvants against MRSA. Currently, multiple antibiotics are used to treat MRSA, but the use of these adjuvants is expected to enable the treatment of MRSA with a single antibiotic and low concentrations of antibiotics.",MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,S. aureus; multidrug resistance; triterpenoid; Panax ginseng,KOREAN RED GINSENG; TRITON X-100; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; COMPOUND K; PROTEIN; LEVEL; GENE,"[Tsutamoto, Sakura; Iwasaki, Yuina; Shinohara, Akari; Iwao, Hiroshi; Osada-Oka, Mayuko] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Div Appl Life Sci, Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, Kyoto, Japan; [Imamiya, Risa] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, Kyoto, Japan; [Samukawa, Keiichi] Osaka Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Osaka, Japan; [Kawada-Matsuo, Miki; Komatsuzawa, Hitoshi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Bacteriol, Hiroshima, Japan; [Yamada, Yui; Mandokoro, Kouki] Kyoto Prefectural Chutan Livestock Hlth Hyg, Fukuchiyama, Japan; [Horiguchi, Yasuhiko] Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Dept Mol Bacteriol, Suita, Japan",Panax ginseng,,Araliaceae,,"saponins, noise, triterpenoids, noise","saponins, noise, triterpenoids, noise",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Panax ginseng,Araliaceae,Panax,Japan

This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of extracts and potential antimicrobial compounds of A. crenata Sims. It was found that the roots of A. crenata Sims have a potential inhibitory effect on Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus, with MICs of 1.56 mg/mL and 0.39 mg/mL, and the leaves of A. crenata Sims have a potential inhibitory effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 3.12 mg/mL and 6.77 mg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, five compounds including one catechin and four bergenins were obtained from roots. These components were identified on the fingerprint spectrum, representing chromatographic peaks 16, 21, 22, 23, and 25, respectively. Among these, 11-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-bergenin and (-)-gallocatechin showed potential inhibition for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC of 0.26 and 0.33 mg/mL, respectively. The roots, stems, and leaves of A. crenata Sims are very similar in chemical composition, with large differences in content. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that 16 batches of A. crenata Sims could be divided into four main production areas: Guizhou, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Jiangxi. Furthermore, molecular docking results showed that 11-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-bergenin had a better affinity for Casein lytic proteinase P (ClpP), and (-)-gallocatechin possessed a strong affinity for LasA hydrolysis protease and LasB elastase.

The isolation and identification of six polyphenoles (1-6), were elucidated for the first time from this plant, including three polyphenolic acid; gallic acid (1); ellagic acid (2); 3,3'-dimethoxyellagic acid (3) and three gallotannines, 2,3-di-O-galloyl-(alpha/beta)-C-4(1)- glucopyranose, nilocitin (4); 1,3-di-O-galloyl-beta-D-C-4(1)-glucopyranose (5); 1,2,3,4,6- penta-Ogalloyl-beta-D-C-4(1)-glucopyranose (6). The structures of all isolated compounds were elucidated by conventional methods, spectroscopic analysis, including ID and 2DNMR, ESIMS and HRESI mass as well. The search for new, potentially biologically active extract becomes much more efficient after identification of all compounds in that mixture. The in vitro antioxidant activity using the stable free radical DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrylhydrazyl) method of the P. atlantica extracts proved that ethyl acetate extract possesses a distinct radical scavenging effect at the different concentrations and the extract completely inhibited DPPH absorbance at a concentration 77 mu l, the percentage of inhibition obtained 96.4% can be considered as a full absorbance inhibition of DPPH. Also, the IC50 (the concentration that inhibits 50% of the absorbance of DPPH) of ethyl acetate extract of P atlantica showed an IC50 value of 8.41 +/- 0.24 mu g/ml compared with IC50 value of ascorbic acid 1.82 +/- 0.33 mu g/ml. It could be concluded from the obtained results that the P. atlantica ethyl acetate extract shows a very high antioxidant capacity which is very close to the value of the reference standard used, which may be attributed to its high polyphenolic content. P. atlantica extracts demonstrated inhibitory effects against pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, NCTC 7447; Bacillus subtilis, NCTC 10400; Escherichia coli, NCTC 10416; Pseudomonas aerogenasa NCIB 9016); Candida albicans, IMRU 3669.

T. dentisepala HAE and TPE were active against all bacterial strains tested, with a minimum inhibitory concentration between 1.0 and 6.0 mg/mL, with the last one being the most active. However, the T. lineata extracts only demonstrated effectiveness against S. typhi and P. aeruginosa. The TPEs from T. dentisepala and T. lineata improved the activity by approximately 30% in all bacteria tested in comparison with the HAEs. The T. dentisepala HAE had a higher total phenolic content than the T. lineata extract, which was consistent with its ABTS(center dot+)-scavenging activity.

Maxim.)","Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.) has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases. The pharmacological properties of meadowsweet are derived from the presence of phenolic compounds of a diverse structure in sufficiently large quantities. The purpose of this study was to examine the vertical distribution of individual groups of phenolic compounds (total phenolics, flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids, catechins, proanthocyanidins, and tannins) and individual phenolic compounds in meadowsweet and to determine the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of extracts from various meadowsweet organs. It was found that the leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots of meadowsweet are characterized by a high total phenolics content (up to 65 mg g(-1)). A high content of flavonoids was determined in the upper leaves and flowers (117-167 mg g(-1)), with high contents of hydroxycinnamic acids in the upper leaves, flowers, and fruits (6.4-7.8 mg g(-1)); high contents of catechins and proanthocyanidins in the roots (45.1 and 3.4 mg g(-1), respectively); and high tannin content in the fruits (38.3 mg g(-1)). Analysis of extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the qualitative and quantitative composition of individual phenolic compounds in various parts of the meadowsweet varied greatly. Among the flavonoids identified in meadowsweet, quercetin derivatives dominate, namely quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, quercetin 3-beta-d-glucoside, and quercetin 4 '-O-glucoside. Quercetin 4 '-O-glucoside (spiraeoside) was found only in the flowers and fruits. Catechin was identified in the leaves and roots of meadowsweet. The distribution of phenolic acids across the plant was also uneven. In the upper leaves, a higher content of chlorogenic acid was determined, and in the lower leaves, a higher content of ellagic acid determined.

In the present study, nine herb species of the Norwegian wild flora or which can be cultivated in Norway were selected for phytogenic evaluation (hops, maral root, mint, oregano, purslane, rosemary, roseroot, sweet wormwood, yarrow). Dried herbs were sequentially extracted with dichloromethane (DCM), ethanol (EtOH) and finally water (H2O) by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The UAE protocol was found to be more rational than conventional Soxhlet with respect to DCM extraction. Total extraction yield was found to be highest for oregano (Origanum vulgare) with 34.4 g 100(-1) g dry matter (DM). H2O-extracts gave the highest yields of the three solvents, with up to 25 g 100(-1) g DM for purslane (Portulaca oleracea ssp. sativa) and mint (Mentha piperita). EtOH- and H2O-extracts were the most efficient extracts with respect to free radical scavenging capacity (ABTS (=2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and oregano, mint, hops (Humulus lupulus) and maral root-leaves (Leuzea carthamoides) were found to be the most efficient antioxidant sources. Hops (EtOH-extract) contained alpha- and beta-acids, xanthohumols, chlorogenic acid and the hitherto unreported 3-O-glucosides of kaempferol and quercetin. Maral root-leaves contained among other compounds hexosides of the 6-hydroxy- and 6-methoxy-kaempferol and -quercetin, whereas roseroot (Rosea rhodiola) revealed contents of rosavin, rhodiosin and rhodionin. Sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) contained chlorogenic acid and several derivatives thereof, scopoletin and poly-methylated flavones (eupatin, casticin, chrysoplenetin). Antimicrobial potential of different plant extracts was demonstrated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the indicator organisms Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and the Atlantic salmon bacterial pathogens Moritella viscosa, Tenacibaculum finnmarkense and Aliivibrio wodanis.

Communities across the globe are using medicinal plants as an alternative treatment against many diseases in rabbits. This study aimed at identifying medicinal plants used by local farmers in Cameroon and evaluate their antibacterial activity alone and in combination with oxytetracycline against some bacterial causative agents of diarrhoea in rabbits. The ethnopharmacological survey was performed in Cameroon's Western and Central regions, where breeders were interviewed about their knowledge on the medicinal plants and plant parts often used to cure rabbit diseases, the methods of preparation and the route of administration. Plants were collected, and extracts were prepared by decoction, infusion and maceration using distilled water. The antibacterial activity of extracts and combinations was evaluated against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Clostridium perfringens (WAL-14572 HM-310) using the microdilution and checkerboard methods. From the survey, fifteen medicinal plants belonging to nine families, with Asteraceae being the most represented, were identified as currently used to treat diarrhoea in rabbits. Bidens pilosa and Psidium guajava were the most mentioned medicinal plant species with 24 and 17 citations, respectively. Leaves were the most commonly used plant parts, and maceration in water was the primary preparation method of remedies administered orally. Out of the forty-five extracts prepared, only six from Tithonia diversifolia (Tdl(M), Tdl(I), Tdl(D)) and Psidium guajava (Pgl(M), Pgl(I), Pgl(D)) exhibited potency with MIC values ranging from 1.25 to 5 mg/mL.

Steud. is a medicinal plant with a very long established and considerable position in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and in those of the other Far East Asian countries (mainly in Vietnam, Laos, Japan, and Korea). In Europe, Americas and Australia, P. tomentosa is known as princess tree, empress tree, or foxglove tree, and it is cultivated as a beautifully blossoming ornamental tree. In TCM, all parts of P. tomentosa (i.e., timber, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits) are used for curative purposes. From a literature survey, a conclusion can be drawn that in phytochemical and ethnopharmaceutical studies relatively less attention has been paid to investigating the chemical composition and biological activity of the leaves than that of the other parts of this medicinal plant and for this reason, our research was focused on antibacterial properties of the phenolics extracted from the P. tomentosa leaves. There are two important novelties of our approach. One novelty is that the phenolics extract from the P. tomentosa leaves was fractionated into six fractions (I-VI, expectedly containing flavonoid aglycons, free phenolic acids, non-polar flavonoid glycosides, polar flavonoid glycosides and phenolic acids liberated by the acidic and basic hydrolysis, respectively). The other novelty is that antibacterial assay was performed for each isolated fraction with the use of high-performance thin-layer chromatography combined with direct bioautography (HPTLC-DB). The best separations were obtained for fractions I and II, somewhat worse separations were obtained for fractions III-V, and the lack of characteristic bands was observed with fraction VI. In the antibacterial assay performed upon the HPTLC fingerprints, the Gram positive Bacillus subtilis and the Gram negative Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria were used. Well pronounced antibacterial activity was established with the selected fingerprint zones derived from fractions I-IV, whereas a lack of antibacterial activity was observed with fractions V and VI. Identification of apigenin and p-coumaric acid in the chromatographic zones from fractions I and II was performed with use of HPTLC and HPLC-DAD-MS, aided by external standards. Fractions III and IV were found to have similar chromatographic patterns, which suggests the presence of semi-polar flavonoid sugar conjugates in the P. tomentosa leaves.",JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,Antibacterial profile; high-performance thin-layer chromatography - direct bioautography; multi-step extraction of phenolics; Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.)

Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by the classical microdilution method. Antiseptic activity against these organisms was evaluated by the plate diffusion method. The antioxidant potential of the extract was evaluated using a method based on the oxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). The extract's chemical profile was analyzed for the presence of alkaloids, saponins, anthraquinones, steroids, tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds according to standard colorimetric methods. Results: The C. brasiliense supercritical CO2 extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against all bacteria tested. It also possesses antioxidant activity, when compared to a vitamin E standard.

In reality, pesticides and fertilizers are vital to agriculture and are useful instruments that farmers can employ to increase yield and guarantee steady productivity throughout the seasons under both favorable and unfavorable conditions. Therefore, in the present study, fertilizing with potassium citrate as a foliar spray and humic acid (HA) as a soil application allowed for the evaluation of vegetative growth parameters (plant height, number of leaves/plant), total phenolic content, total carbohydrate, antioxidant activity, the essential oil (EO) composition, and bulb yield of garlic (Allium sativum L.). These were carried out in two field experiments throughout the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 growth seasons. A gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) apparatus was performed to determine the chemical composition of the isolated EOs. The antifungal activity of the EOs was assessed against two fungi, Fusarium proliferatum and Macrophomina phaseolina, that cause geranium plants to wilt and decay. The findings indicated that applying HA at a rate of 2 g/L with potassium citrate at a rate of 5 or 10 mL/L produced garlic bulbs with the highest levels of productivity and diameter. The diverse treatments between HA with potassium citrate resulted in significant variations in the bioactive components, such as total phenol content, antioxidant activity, total carbohydrate, and sulfur content. The analysis of the EOs revealed the presence of dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, methyl 2-propenyl trisulfide, allitridin, and methyl allyl disulfide and allyl tetrasulfide as main compounds. By gradually increasing the concentration of the garlic EO to 4000 mu g/mL compared to the control, the inhibition percentage of fungal growth of F. proliferatum and M. phaseolina was increased.

Such microorganisms can cause food and feed spoilage, food poisoning and even more severe diseases, resulting in human death. In order to overcome this phenomenon, it is essential to identify novel antimicrobials that are naturally occurring, biologically effective and increasingly safe for human use. The development of gemmotherapy extracts (GTEs) using plant parts such as buds and young shoots has emerged as a novel approach to treat/prevent human conditions due to their associated antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial properties that all require careful evaluations. Seven GTEs obtained from plant species like the olive (Olea europaea L.), almond (Prunus amygdalus L.), black mulberry (Morus nigra L.), walnut (Juglans regia L.), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.), blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) were tested for their antimicrobial efficiency via agar diffusion and microbroth dilution methods. The antimicrobial activity was assessed for eight bacterial (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes), five moulds (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium expansum) and one yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The agar diffusion method revealed the blackberry GTE as the most effective since it inhibited the growth of three bacterial, four moulds and one yeast species, having considered the total number of affected microorganism species. Next to the blackberry, the olive GTE appeared to be the second most efficient, suppressing five bacterial strains but no moulds or yeasts. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for each GTE and the microorganisms tested. Noticeably, the olive GTE appeared to feature the strongest bacteriostatic and bactericidal outcome, displaying specificity for S. aureus, E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. The other GTEs, such as blueberry, walnut, black mulberry and almond (the list indicates relative strength), were more effective at suppressing microbial growth than inducing microbial death. However, some species specificities were also evident, while the blackcurrant GTE had no significant antimicrobial activity. Having seen the antimicrobial properties of the analysed GTEs, especially the olive and black mulberry GTEs, these could be envisioned as potential antimicrobials that might enhance antibiotic therapies efficiency, while the blackberry GTE would act as an antifungal agent. Some of the GTE mixtures analysed have shown interesting antimicrobial synergies, and all the antimicrobial effects observed argue for extending these studies to include pathological microorganisms.",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,MDPI,gemmotherapy extracts; antimicrobial activity; antifungal activity; Morus nigra; Juglans regia; Prunus amygdalus; Olea europaea; Ribes nigrum; Rubus fruticosus; Vaccinium myrtillus,VACCINIUM-MYRTILLUS L.; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; HEALTH-BENEFITS; PRUNUS-DULCIS; RIBES-NIGRUM; MORUS-NIGRA; ANTIOXIDANT; LEAVES; RESISTANCE; BIOFILM,"[Hejja, Melinda; Jolji, Maria] Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr & Food Sci & Environm Management, Doctoral Sch Nutr & Food Sci, Boszormeny Str 128, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Hejja, Melinda; Mihok, Emoke; Alaya, Amina; Jolji, Maria; Mathe, Endre] Univ Debrecen, Inst Nutr Sci, Fac Agr & Food Sci & Environm Management, Boszormeny Str 128, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Mihok, Emoke; Alaya, Amina] Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr & Food Sci & Environm Management, Doctoral Sch Anim Sci, Boszormeny Str 128, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Gyoergy, Eva] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Fac Econ Socio Human Sci & Engn, Dept Food Engn, Libertatii Sq 1, Miercurea Ciuc 530104, Romania; [Meszaros, Noemi; Turcus, Violeta; Mathe, Endre] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Dept Life Sci, Fac Med, L Rebreanu Str 86, Arad 300041, Romania; [Turcus, Violeta] Costin C Kiritescu Natl Inst Econ Res, Romanian Acad, CE MONT Mt Econ Ctr, Petreni Str 49, Suceava 725700, Romania; [Olah, Neli Kinga] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, L Rebreanu Str 86, Arad 310414, Romania; [Olah, Neli Kinga] PlantExtrakt Ltd, Cluj Napoca 407059, Romania","Olea europaea, Juglans regia, Vaccinium myrtillus, Prunus amygdalus, Morus nigra, Rubus fruticosus, Ribes nigrum, Listeria",,"Oleaceae, Juglandaceae, Ericaceae, Rosaceae, Moraceae, Rosaceae, Grossulariaceae, Rubiaceae",,noise,noise,"Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris","positive, positive, negative, positive, positive, negative, negative, negative","Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium citrinum","Olea europaea, Juglans regia, Vaccinium myrtillus, Prunus amygdalus, Morus nigra, Rubus fruticosus, Ribes nigrum, Listeria","Oleaceae, Juglandaceae, Ericaceae, Rosaceae, Moraceae, Rosaceae, Grossulariaceae, Rubiaceae","Olea, Juglans, Vaccinium, Prunus, Morus, Rubus, Ribes, Listeria",Hungary

The phytochemical composition and biological activity of M. zavattarii have been not reported yet. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate phytochemical constituents and evaluate the antibacterial activity of different solvents' leaf extracts and analyze the molecular binding capacity of isolated compounds from the chloroform leaf extract of M. zavattarii. Accordingly, preliminary phytochemical screening was tested by using standard procedures and the result indicated that phytosterols and terpenoids as major and others like alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins, phlobatannin, and coumarins were detected as minor in extracts. Antibacterial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the disk diffusion agar method, and the activities revealed that chloroform extract showed the highest inhibition zones, 12.08 +/- 0.38, 14.00 +/- 0.50, and 15.58 +/- 0.63 mm against Escherichia coli at 50, 75, and 125 mg/mL concentrations, respectively, compared to that of n-hexane and methanol extracts at respective concentrations. Methanol extract showed the highest zone of inhibition 16.42 + 0.52 against Staphylococcus aureus at 125 mg/mL concentration compared to that of n-hexane and chloroform extracts. Two compounds, namely, beta-amyrin palmitate (1) and lutein (2) were isolated and identified for the first time from the chloroform leaf extract of M. zavattarii, and structural elucidations of these compounds were accomplished by using spectroscopic methods (IR, UV, and NMR). For the molecular docking study, 1G2A, which is a protein of E. coli and chloramphenicol standard target, was selected. Binding energies of -9.09, -7.05, and -6.87 kcal/mol were calculated for beta-amyrin palmitate, lutein, and chloramphenicol, respectively. The drug-likeness property result indicated that both beta-amyrin palmitate and lutein violated two rules of Lipinski's rule of five with molecular weight (g/mol) > 500 and LogP > 4.15.

Oral infections are the most prevalent diseases in man. The Rhus family has been found to have antimicrobial, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Few studies have been done onRhus vulgarisMeikle. A study was conducted to determine the effect ofRhus vulgarisMeikle stem bark extracts against selected oral pathogenic microorganisms and the safety of the extracts in vitro and in vivo. Methods Methanol:dichloromethane (1:1), methanol and aqueous extracts were tested for bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against Methicillin ResistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA),Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutansandCandida albicans. Cytotoxicity of the active extracts was determined using Vero E6 cell lines while safety was evaluated in mice and rats. Phytochemical screening was performed on the methanol extracts. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons tests were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20.0 for antimicrobial assay and acute toxicity testing. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison tests were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 for cytotoxicity assay. Results Methanol extract ofRhus vulgarisshowed significant antimicrobial activity against MRSA (12.00 +/- 0.00 mm;p-value of < 0.005; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of 0.391 mg/ml; Minimum Bactericidal Concentration of 1.563 mg/ml). The extract were not cytotoxic at 100 mu g/ml which was the highest tested concentration. In acute dermal irritation testing, the methanol extract resulted in mild irritation with erythema and flaking that cleared within 8 days. There were no observable adverse effects from oral administration of the extracts (acute oral toxicity testing) at concentrations of 50 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. Tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides, alkaloids and phenols were detected in the methanol extract.

The plant is used for bronchitis, cough, asthma, and gastrointestinal ailments, including dyspepsia, colic pain, and diarrhea. The phenolic and flavonoid contents of T. linearifolia were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by LC-MS analysis and spectrophotometric assays. These analyses revealed the presence of 60.67 mg/g of GAE (Gallic Acid Equivalents) and 26.79 mg/ g of RE (Rutin Equivalents) of the phenolics and flavonoids, respectively, in the aerial parts of the plants' ethanolic extract. Cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (2.26 %), pelargonidin-3-O-rutinoside (2.36 %), gallocatechin (2.94 %), taxifolin (1.22 %), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (0.81 %), quercetin-3-O- retinosie (1.20 %), luteolin (0.99 %), apigenin (2.0 %), dimethoxy luteolin (2.97 %), and pinobanksin-3-O-acetate (2.56 %) were detected to be the major flavonoids, whereas the syringic acid hexoside (1.38 %), and rosmarinic acid (2.54 %) were among the most abundant phenolic acids in the plant's extract. The DPPH scavenging activity was measured at an IC50 value of 34.48 lg/mL. In addition, potential reducing, metal chelating, and free radical scavenging potentials were exhib-ited in the in vitro assays, i.e., ABST, ORAC, FRAP, and MC. The remarkable antioxidant activity of the plant was attributed to its phenolic and flavonoid contents. The plant extract had strong cyto-toxic effects on three types of cancer cell lines, i.e., MCF-7, HepG2, and Panc-1, with IC50 values of 24.023, 22.94, and 33.30 lg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the plant extract also exhibited cyto-toxic effects greater than the standard anticancer drug, doxorubicin, against all the tested cell lines. The in-silico binding studies also demonstrated that the phytochemical constituents of T. linearifolia have a high binding affinity against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein, which supported the anticancer potentials of the plant. The antimicrobial assay conducted with the well-diffusion method revealed the moderate effects of the plant's extract against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans. However, weak antimicro-bial effects were recorded against the Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings corroborated the immense health benefits of the plant, and substanti-ated the medicinal value claims of the plant, which is currently under use in different forms as part of the locals' folk-medicinal chest.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

It also assessed the phytochemical constituents and antioxidant properties of the plant. This was with a view to tackling problem of multidrug resistance development by microorganisms. The stem bark of V. paradoxa was harvested from Ijagbo, Kwara State, Nigeria, in the month of April, 2016. The plant sample was oven dried at 40 degrees C using hot-air oven and ground into fine powder. The powdered sample was cold extracted using methanol and sterile distilled water in ratio 3:2 (v/v). The mixture obtained was concentrated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized. The crude extract collected was screened for antimicrobial, phytochemical and antioxidant properties. The crude extract was later partitioned into fractions using different organic solvents in the order of their polarity. The antimicrobial potentials of the various solvent fractions were determined using agar-well diffusion method. The active fractions were further partially purified by combination of thin layer and column chromatography. The rate of killing, protein, nucleotide and potassium ions leakages of the active fractions were determined using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as representatives of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria respectively. The most active partially purified fraction was analysed using GC-MS. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, reducing sugar and cardiac glycosides. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the crude extract ranged between 0.545 mg/mL and 2.187 mg/mL while those of aqueous, butanol and ethylacetate fractions ranged between 0.31 mg/mL and 5.00 mg/mL, 0.31 mg/mL and 2.50 mg/mL and 0.31 mg/mL and 2.50 mg/mL respectively. The time kill assay showed that the percentage of the cells killed increased with increasing concentrations of the fractions, as well as, contact time intervals. Leakages of protein, potassium ions and nucleotides followed the same trend observed for killing rate. Vitellaria paradoxa extract exhibited 50% inhibition of DPPH free radicals at 0.008777 mg/mL, whereas ascorbic acid used as standard had IC50 of 0.078777 mg/mL.

The qualitative detection shows that all the representative groups were present in the analyzed samples. The examined samples display the greatest amount of total flavonoid content (TFC, 78.2 +/- 0.22 mg QE/mg) and total phenolic contents (TPC, 66.2 +/- 0.33 mg GAE/g) in the SPM extract. The SPM extract proceeded to the ESI-LC-MS to identify the chemical constituents that presented nineteen bioactive ingredients, depicted for the first time from S. petiolata mainly contributed by flavonoids. The analyzed samples produced considerable capability to defy the microbes. The SPM extract was observed effective and offered an appreciable zone of inhibition (ZOI), 17.8 +/- 0.04 mm against the bacterial strain Salmonellatyphi and 18.8 +/- 0.04 mm against Klebsiella pneumonia. Moreover, the SPM extract also exhibited 19.4 +/- 0.01 mm against the bacterial strains Bacillus atrophaeus and 18.8 +/- 0.04 mm against Bacillus subtilis in comparison to the standard levofloxacin (Gram-negative) and erythromycin (Gram-positive) bacterial strains that displayed 23.6 +/- 0.02 mm and 23.2 +/- 0.05 mm ZOI, correspondingly. In addition to that, the SPD fraction was noticed efficiently against the fungal strains used with ZOI 19.07 +/- 0.02 mm against Aspergillus parasiticus and 18.87 +/- 0.04 mm against the Aspergillus niger as equated to the standard with 21.5 +/- 0.02 mm ZOI.

In this regard, the root of Plectocephalus varians (P. varians) is claimed to have a beneficiary effect in treating cancer and hemorrhoids in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed at the phytochemical investigation, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of n-hexane, acetone, and methanolic extracts of P. varians root. The different crude extracts of P. varians were obtained through maceration technique. The total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) of the extracts were estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu Reagent (FCR) and aluminum chloride colorimetric assays, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The antibacterial activities of the extracts were assessed by using disc diffusion method. The results echoed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, steroids, phenols, tannins, anthraquinones, terpenoids, polyphenols, and glycosides in the root of P. varians. The methanolic root extract (MRE) had the highest TPC (107.18 mg GAE/g) and TFC (120.194 mg QE/g) followed by acetone root extract (ARE) (TPC = 98.68 mg GAE/g; TFC = 64.038 mg QE/g) and n-hexane root extract (HRE) (TPC = 12.39 mg GAE/g; TFC = 9.917 mg QE/g).

Targ. Tozz. (Araceae), locally known as Elbgouga, holds significant traditional importance in Algeria for the treatment of various human ailments, including pain, infections, inflammation, digestive disorders, cancer, skin problems, eczema, wounds, and burns. The aim of this study was to explore for the first time the phytochemical profile, antioxidant, antibacterial, and inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes, DNA protection, and capacity to promote wound healing. Preliminary phytochemical experiments were conducted to evaluate the major classes of bioactive compounds, in addition to the total phenol and flavonoid amounts in AVEE. An LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted to clarify the phytochemical composition of this particular botanical species. The antioxidant capacity was assessed using DPPH and ABTS(+) radical scavenging tests. The agar diffusion approach was used to ascertain the antibacterial efficacy against four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium). Cholinesterase inhibition was evaluated using a colorimetric method that relies on Ellman's reaction. The protective effects of AVEE on pBR322 plasmid DNA damaged by H2O2 and UV treatment were assessed by their DNA-breaking forms. The in vivo acute dermal toxicity and wound healing potential of the AVEE ointment (1-5% AVEO) were also investigated, and histological analyses were carried out on biological samples. Five protein targets were the subject of an in silico molecular docking investigation (TNF alpha, TGFBR1, IL-1 ss, GSK-3 ss, and NOS) and ADMET studies of the main components of the extracts were performed. The screening of phytochemicals revealed a significant concentration of phenolic compounds (176.00 +/- 1.08 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of dry extract), mainly flavonoids (81.21 +/- 1.24 mg of quercetin equivalents/g of dry extract). Three major compounds were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis, belonging mainly to the class of flavonoids, with rutin as the most abundant compound (11.85 mg/g extract), followed by hesperidin (4.125 mg/g extract). A conspicuous presence of isoquercitrin (1.327 mg/g extract) was also found. Small amounts of flavonoids and phenolic acids were also detected (catechin, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, salicylic acid, kaempferol, and luteolin). DPPH assay showed higher antioxidant capacity compared to the ABTS+ assay (142.60 +/- 5.52 mu g/mL and 236.10 +/- 0.22 mu g/mL, respectively). AVEE was effective against all selected bacterial strains; however, the highest zone of inhibition (36.00 +/- 0.1 mm) was noted against E. faecium. The extract of the plant significantly inhibited both AChE and BChE (89.98 +/- 18.76 mu g/mL inhibitory activity against AChE and 98.28 +/- 44.68 mu g/mL inhibitory activity against BChE, respectively). The ethanolic extract of A. vulgare and quercetin exhibited more significant DNA protection action in form I, with percentages of 90.41 and 94.23%, respectively, compared to form II, where the percentages were 27.91 and 51.92%, respectively. The AVEO formulation may be safely administered by topical application. A statistically significant wound contraction was discovered in the group treated with 5% AVEO compared to the groups that were not treated or treated with petroleum jelly. Furthermore, there was no notable disparity detected between the group treated with 5% AVEO and the group treated with the reference drug. The 5% AVEO-treated group showed, after the research was complete, the most significant percentage of wound contraction (96.90 +/- 0.42%). Moreover, the topical application of the formulation improved histological parameters. In silico study showed that rutin, hesperidin, and isoquercitrin had a high affinity to the five main targets that might contribute to the wound healing potential of A. vulgare ethanolic extract.

Aim of the study: To assess the potential of the crude drug as an anti-Candida agent with anti-inflammatory properties. The bioactivity and phytochemical composition of a dry extract of the plant was investigated. Material and methods: The pharmacognostic description of the crude drug is carried out for the first time, including macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the different organs, physicochemical and extractive values (petroleum ether-, ethanol- and water-soluble). The dry extract from T. andina was evaluated as anti fungal against pathogenic Candida sp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from vaginal infections and reference strains, by the macrodilution and microdilution assays. The normal vaginal microbiome in women is characterized by the dominance of lactic acid-producing bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus spp. The effect of T. andina extract on Lactobacillus strains was also assayed. The inhibitory effect on proinflammatory enzymes (cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and phospholipase A(2)) and antioxidant capacity was studied. The chemical profile was analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS. Results: The hydroalcoholic extract inhibited the growth of all yeasts with Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values between 12.5 and 400 mu g GAE/mL and the MIC values on Lactobacillus were higher than the MIC values against Candida isolates ( > 400 mu g GAE/mL). These results indicate that the hydroalcoholic extract could be used without affecting the normal microbiota of vaginal fluid. The extract showed antioxidant activity and could modulate the inflammatory process by three pathways (sPLA(2), COX-2, LOX). The plant extract contained high total phenolic levels (386.9 +/- 1.7 mg GAE/g dry extract) and flavonoid levels (260.4 +/- 2.7 mg GAE/g dry extract). Fifty phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS. They were mainly hydrolysable and condensed tannins.

S. elaeagnifolium has shown molluscicidal and nematicidal and cancer-inhibitory effects, anti-inflammatory, analgesic activity, and antibacterial activity. The objective of this research is to improve this plant and assess its antibacterial and antioxidant properties as well as its total polyphenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). The Folin-Ciocalteu method and the aluminium-trichloride method were used to determine TPC and TFC in hydro-ethanolic (HEE) and hydro-acetonic (HAE) leaf extract. Three assays were performed to determine the antioxidant activity: the DPPH test (radical 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), the FRAP test (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), and the TAC test. Disk diffusion and microdilution were used to test antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans. The hydro-ethanolic extract 2.54 +/- 0.4 mg EAG/g has a greater polyphenol concentration than the hydro-acetonic extract 1.58 +/- 0.03 mg EAG/g. Although the flavonoid content of the hydro-acetonic extract (0.067 +/- 0.001 mg EQ/g) is larger than that of the hydro-ethanolic extract (0.012 +/- 0.001 mg EQ/g), the flavonoid content of the hydro-ethanolic extract (0.012 +/- 0.001 mg EQ/g). The DPPH values were IC-50 = 0.081 +/- 0.004 mg/mL for hydro-ethanoic extract and 0.198 +/- 0.019 mg/mL for hydro-acetonic extract, both extracts superior to BHT (0.122 +/- 0.021 g/mL). While the FRAP assay showed a low iron-reducing power values for both extracts compared to BHT), the overall antioxidant activity of the two extracts was found to be considerable. The overall antioxidant activity of the hydro-ethanolic extract was 8.95 +/- 0.42 mg EAA/g, whereas the total antioxidant activity of the hydro-acetonic extract was 6.44 +/- 0.61 mg EAA/g. In comparison with the antibiotic Erythromycin, HAE and HEE from S. elaeagnifolium leaves demonstrated significant antibacterial action. HAE had the best inhibitory efficacy against Bacillus subtilis DSM 6333, with an inhibition diameter of 10.5 +/- 0.50 mm and a MIC of 7.5 +/- 0.00 mg/mL, as well as against Proteus mirabilis ATCC 29906, with an inhibitory diameter of 8.25 +/- 0.75 mm and a MIC of 15 +/- 0.00 mg/mL.",MOLECULES,MDPI,Solanum elaeagnifolium; polyphenols; flavonoids; antimicrobial activity; antioxidant activity,PHENOLIC CONTENT; ANTIBACTERIAL; FRUITS; FLAVONOIDS; CAPACITY; EXTRACTS; SPICE; L.,"[Bouslamti, Mohammed; Lyoussi, Badiaa; Benjelloun, Ahmed Samir] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci, Labs Nat Subst Pharmacol Environm Modeling Hlth &, Fes 30000, Morocco; [El Barnossi, Azeddine] Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci Dhar El Mahraz, Lab Biotechnol Environm Agrifood & Hlth, Fes 30050, Morocco; [Kara, Mohammed] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci Dhar El Mahraz, Dept Biol, Lab Biotechnol Conservat & Valorisat Nat Resource, Fes 30000, Morocco; [Alotaibi, Badriyah S.; Al Kamaly, Omkulthom] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Assouguem, Amine] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Lab Funct Ecol & Environm, Imouzzer St, Fes 30000, Morocco",Solanum elaeagnifolium,,Solanaceae,,"phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics","phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics","Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis","negative, positive",Candida albicans,Solanum elaeagnifolium,Solanaceae,Solanum,Morocco

(durian) belongs to the Malvaceae family. It is known as the King of Tropical Fruit because of its unique characteristics. The edible part of durian, however, is only about 33% of the fruit while the non-edible parts such as the seed and peels (rinds) are considered as fruit waste responsible for environmental pollution. Thus, the present study was carried out to compare the percentage yields and volatile components from methanol extract and essential oils of the peels of four varieties of durian (Raja Kunyit [D197], Hajah Hasmah [D168], Sultan [D24], and Golden Bun [D13]). The antimicrobial activity of all the extracts and their volatile chemical constituents were also evaluated. Cold maceration was used for the solvent (methanol) extraction. The essential oil extraction was carried out using hydro-distillation and solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) methods. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against selected microbes using the well diffusion method while the characterization of chemical constituents in the essential oils and crude methanolic extracts was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The highest yields of essential oils were obtained from D24 which were 0.030% and 0.014% from SFME and hydro-distillation extraction, respectively, while the highest and most significant (p < 0.05) yield of methanol extract (8.79%) was obtained from D197. From the GC-MS analysis, butanoic acid was the major compound in the essential oil of durian peels in the four varieties of durians evaluated. Besides butanoic acid, 1-tridecene, 1-pentadecene, and 1-heptadecene were also present in the four varieties. The D168 possesses strong activity against three bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).

Our ability to effectively treat diseases is based on the discovery of potent drugs for the treatment of these challenging diseases. Traditional medicines are one of the major sources for the discovery of safe, effective and economical drug candidates. In order to validate its antibacterial, antifungal and insecticidal potentials with respect to traditional uses, we have screened for the first time Polygonum hydropiper against pathogenic bacterial, fungal strains and a variety of insects. Methods: Polygonum hydropiper samples including crude extract (Ph.Cr), subsequent fractions; n-hexane (Ph.Hex), chloroform (Ph.Chf), ethyl acetate (Ph.EtAc), n-Butanol (Ph.Bt), aqueous (Ph.Aq) and crude saponins (Ph.Sp) were tested against pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains. Insecticidal activities were performed against Tribolium castaneum and Rhyzopertha dominica and Monomorium pharaonis. Ph.Cr was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for preliminary identification of chemical constituents. Results: In disc diffusion assay, Ph.Chf, Ph.Hex, Ph.EtAc and Ph.Sp exhibited highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis. MICs of Ph.Chf against Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, P.mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 32.00, 13.33, 10.66, 5.33, 64.00, 8.66 and 10.66 mu g/ml respectively.

In this study, aqueous ethanol (AE) and aqueous methanol (AM) extracts from aerial parts and roots of Z. spinosa were investigated. The total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents and antioxidant capacities in terms of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were determined, and the correlations among the results were assessed using Pearson's correlation. The antimicrobial activity was assessed through agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. Phytochemical screening showed that Z. spinosa extracts had alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenoids, phenols, and flavonoids in different abundances. The aerial part-AE extract contained low TPC (30.17 +/- 4.24 mg GAE/g) and TFC (7.40 +/- 1.02 mg QE/g) and displayed significant antioxidant capacity in the DPPH (IC50 = 52.17 +/- 7.30 mu g/mL), H2O2 (91.22 +/- 2.60 mu g/mL), and FRAP (EC50 = 98.70 +/- 2.21 mu g/mL) assays. By contrast, the root-AM extract contained high amounts of TPC (87.72 +/- 7.75 mg GAE/g) and TFC (25.60 +/- 1.57 mg QE/g). It showed significantly high antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 12.33 +/- 1.88 mu g/mL in the DPPH and 39.37 +/- 2.59 mu g/mL in the H2O2 assays, as well as reducing power capacity with an EC50 value of 20.82 +/- 1.14 mu g/mL in the FRAP assay. Both TPC and TFC were exhibited negative correlations (p<0.01) with the IC50 and EC50 values obtained in the applied antioxidant assays. The aerial part-AM extract showed the highest inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (26.5 +/- 0.20 mm), followed by Shigella flexneri (19.4 +/- 0.40 mm) and Proteus mirabilis (17.7 +/- 0.49 mm). S. aureus was the most affected microorganism with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 128 mu g/mL against the aerial part-AM extract. Interestingly, all evaluated extracts showed potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans. However, aerial part-AM was the most effective, with an inhibition zone of 12.6 +/- 0.17 mm.

Quinic acid with contents ranging from 77.25 +/- 6.04 mg/100 g DW (ExMBA) to 658.56 +/- 0.25 mg/100 g DW of ExHAM was the most important organic acid in all the breadfruit extracts, while limonene was quantitatively the main monoterpene with contents between 85.86 +/- 0.23 mg/100 g DW (ExMIT) and 565.45 +/- 0.24 mg/100 g DW (ExITS). The antibacterial activity of the extracts was evaluated on twelve pathogens including six Gram (+) bacteria and six Gram (-) bacteria. By the solid medium disc method, except for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all the bacteria were sensitive to one or more extracts. Inhibitory Halo Diameters (IHDs) ranged from 8 mm to 16 mm. Salmonella enterica, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio fischeri were the most sensitive with IHD > 14 mm for ExITS. By the liquid microdilution method, MICs ranged from 3.12 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL and varied depending on the extract. Bacillus megaterium was the most sensitive with MICs <= 12.5 mg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, and Vibrio fischeri were the least sensitive with all MICs >= 12.5 mg/mL. ExHAM was most effective with a MIC of 3.12 mg/mL on Staphylococcus aureus and 6.25 mg/mL on Salmonella enterica. The antioxidant power of the extracts was evaluated by the FRAP method. The activity ranged from 5.44 +/- 0.35 (ExMBA) to 14.83 +/- 0.11 mmol Fe2+/kg DW (ExHAM). Breadfruit from different regions of Comoros contained different classes of secondary metabolites well known for their important pharmacological properties.

The objective of the present research was to explore the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory characteristics of the aqueous raspberry extract through in vitro assays. Materials and methods R. idaeus aqueous extract was prepared and examined for its antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) bacteria and Candida albicans (C. albicans) fungi using the agar -well diffusion method, and the antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH (2, 2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate) radical scavenging assay and the hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of the prepared extract was investigated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and egg albumin denaturation assays. Results R. idaeus fruit extract displayed strong antimicrobial activity at a higher concentration of 100 mu L with a 26 mm zone of inhibition against Streptococcus mutans and 24 mm for Candida albicans. The extract showed 87.42% hydrogen peroxide free radical scavenging activity and inhibited 91.12% DPPH free radicals at the highest concentration of 50 mu g/mL. The extract showed effective anti-inflammatory activity by preventing the denaturation of bovine serum albumin (80%) and egg albumin proteins (77%) at the highest concentration of 50 mu g/mL. The free radical scavenging activity positively correlates with the increased concentration of the prepared extract against DPPH and hydrogen peroxide free radicals, thus showing the raspberry extract's potent antioxidant activity. Similarly, the anti-inflammatory assay result shows that the prepared raspberry aqueous extract has excellent anti-inflammatory activity by preventing the denaturation of bovine serum albumin and egg albumin protein in a dose -dependent manner. Conclusion The meticulously prepared raspberry extract exhibited noteworthy antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory characteristics, and owing to its astounding therapeutic benefits it holds a tremendous promise as a natural alternative in the field of oral medicine especially in the management of oral mucosal lesions, oral potentially malignant lesions such as lichen planus and leukoplakia, candidiasis, oral cancer and oral mucositis.

The objective was to explore whether these secondary metabolites are involved in defense against phytopathogenic fungi. To do this, the alkaloidal response of 6-leaf seedlings of A. muricata was analyzed, previously inoculated with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Rhizopus stolonifer. Before and after inoculation, alkaloidal extracts of roots, stems, and leaves were obtained, and the antifungal activity was evaluated in vitro. The alkaloids anonaine, reticuline, nornuciferine, assimilobine, and coreximine were identified. C. gloeosporioides caused variable increases in the production of anonaine, reticuline and nornuciferine (10-1200%), while R. stolonifer only stimulated the increase of nornuciferin and anonaine (10%) in the stems and leaves.

Maximum yield of phenolics was obtained from partly open flowers, with esterified hydroxycinnamic acids (mainly ferulic acid) forming the major component. Scopoletin-a coumarin product of ferulic acid - was isolated consistently from senescent flowers by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Approximately 200 mg of fresh floral tissue extracted with one millilitre solvent (methanol:water :: 30:70) yielded up to 1.6 mg of ferulic acid and 40 mu g of scopoletin from partly open (at 18:00 h) and senescent (at 06:00 h) blooms respectively. Along with other hydroxycinnamic acid and coumarin components of M. paniculata flowers detected by HPLC, o-coumaric acid and isoauraptene were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Various free-radical scavenging assays revealed the ferulic acid fraction to have stronger antioxidant activities than the scopoletin fraction, but no antibiotic activity was detected for ferulic acid. Total antioxidant capacities of ferulic acid and scopoletin fractions were estimated to be 9% and 7.8% of that of ascorbic acid standard, respectively. Scopoletin fraction exhibited Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations at 0.585 mg.mL(-1) against Bacillus subtilis and 1.372 mg.mL(-1) against Escherichia coli.

Secondary metabolites content showed a significant difference among the evaluated parts. Multivariate data analysis (MVDA) classified the parts into three groups based on their metabolomic profiling and the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of their extracts. The highest content of secondary metabolites, particularly in the leaves and fruits, was reflected in the DPPH radical scavenging activity and consequently in the IC50 of their extracts. The leaves and fruits extracts showed the lowest IC50 followed by the male parts extract (62.8, 78.9 and 134.4 mu g/ ml, respectively). Individual polyphenols were also determined by HPLC, which revealed the dominance of rutin, spigenin-7-glucoside, vanillic and rosmarinic acids, and kaempferol in the leaves. p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, sinapic, and cinnamic acids and chrysin were the dominant polyphenols in the male parts extract.

Therefore, the isolated compound 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde (syringaldehyde) was evaluated as modulator of Staphylococcus aureus pump efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance. The isolation of compounds was performed using chromatographic techniques and the structural elucidation was carried out by spectroscopic methods. In order to evaluate syringaldehyde ability to modulate S. aureus antibiotic resistance, its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mu g/ml) was first determinate, then, the tested antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in the presence of the syringaldehyde in a sub-inhibitory concentration. The chromatographic procedures led to isolation of twelve compounds from P. pachycladus including fatty acids, steroids, chlorophyll derivatives, phenolics and a lignan. The syringaldehyde did not show any antibacterial activity at 256 mu g/ml against S. aureus. On the other hand the compound was able to reduce the antibiotic concentration (tetracycline, norfloxacin, ethidium bromide) required to inhibit the growth of drug-resistant bacteria, showing the ability of syringaldehyde of inhibiting the efflux pump on these bacteria.

These beverages are believed to possess the capacity to safeguard against non-communicable ailments such as coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, antimicrobial infections, and other dietary-related disorders. Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) is a commonly used botanical ingredient in therapeutic tea production. It is renowned for its highly valuable essential oil, which has significant commercial demand. This study examines the functional content and antioxidant effects of fermented beverages derived from lemongrass. We employed the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to carry out the fermentation process on the lemongrass compositions, extending the duration from t = 24 to t = 96 h. We used non-fermented samples as control. This investigation identified numerous active biomolecules and polyphenols in the fermented samples, including flavonoids, tannins, cardiac glycosides, coumarins, terpenoids, steroids, saponins, and reducing sugars.

We performed the bioactivity-guided (antioxidant and antimicrobial) screening of eight fractions obtained from the ethyl acetate phase of C. fascicularis. The antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP, and the antibacterial activity was measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. The results of bioactivity-guided isolation indicated that the major antioxidant compounds in the ethanolic extracts of C. fascicularis may be present in fractions (Fr.) (A-G, obtained after silica gel column chromatography). Fr. (D-I, obtained after silica gel column chromatography) is a fraction of C. fascicularis with antimicrobial activity. The structures of compounds were determined by spectral analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) combined with the available literature on secondary metabolites of C. fascicularis leaves. In this study, 17 compounds were identified, including four phenolics (1, 3-4, and 14), a phenylpropane (2), five terpenoids (5-7, 12, and 15), four flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides (8-10 and 16), and two lignins (13 and 17). Compounds 4-7, 13-15, and 17 were isolated from the genus Camellia for first time. The remaining compounds were also isolated from C. fascicularis for first time. The evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities revealed that compounds 1, 3, 9, 11, and 17 exhibited higher antioxidant activity than the positive control drug (ascorbic acid), and compounds 4, 8, 10, and 13 showed similar activity to ascorbic acid. The other compounds had weaker or no significant antioxidant activities. The MIC of antibacterial activity for compounds 4, 7, and 11-13 against P. aeruginosa was comparable to that of the positive control drug tetracycline at 125 mu g/mL, and other secondary metabolites inhibited E. coli and S. aureus at 250-500 mu g/mL.

We here extended our study on the leaf extract and identified its phytoconstituents using HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS. In addition, we explored its antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiaging activities in vitro and in an animal model, Caenorhabditis elegans. Results from HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS confirmed that the leaves contain 23 secondary metabolites consisting of condensed tannins, flavonol glycosides, flavone glycosides, and flavonol diglycosides. The leaf extract demonstrated significant antioxidant activity in vitro with IC50 value of 5 mu g/mL in the DPPH assay and 18.32 mu g/mL in the FRAP assay. It also inhibited four enzymes (collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and tyrosinase) crucially involved in skin remodeling and aging processes with comparable activities to reference drugs along with four pure secondary metabolites identified from the extract. In accordance with the in vitro result, in vivo tests using two transgenic strains of C. elegans demonstrated its ability to reverse oxidative stress. Evidence included an increased survival rate in nematodes treated with the prooxidant juglone to 68.9% compared to the 24.8% in untreated worms and a reduced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner to 77.8%. The leaf extract also reduced levels of the expression of HSP 16.2 in a dose-dependent manner to 86.4%. Nuclear localization of the transcription factor DAF-16 was up to 10 times higher in worms treated with the leaf extract than in the untreated worms. The extract also inhibited the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a pathogen in skin infections) and reduced the swimming and swarming mobilities in a dose-dependent fashion.

Burns are complicated traumatic injuries caused by several physical or chemical factors. Plants with a wide range of secondary metabolites, with valuable properties like antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, can be a promising source of wound healing agents. Materials and Methods. Effects of hydromethanolic extracts of Lythrum salicaria and Hypericum scabrum, individually and in combination, were assessed in second-degree burn wounds in rats in comparison to a white oleaginous base (negative control) and silver sulfadiazine (positive control). Histological assessments as well as total thiol molecules, lipid peroxidation, and total antioxidant power were evaluated in skin tissue samples. Total phenol, flavonoids, and tannins along with the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the extracts were also assessed. Results. Total phenol, total flavonoid, and total tannin amounts for L. salicaria and H. scabrum were 331 +/- 3.7 and 308.1 +/- 5.2 mu g gallic acid/mg extract, 5.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.3 +/- 0.3 mu g quercetin/mg extract, and 430 +/- 2.33 and 13.4 +/- 0.5 mu g tannic acid/mg extract, respectively. H. scabrum significantly inhibited S. aureus and L. salicaria moderately suppressed Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans growth. Wound contraction percentage with L. salicaria and H. scabrum was 89.5 +/- 3.7 and 77.6 +/- 4.1, respectively. A well-organized epidermal layer and normal appearance in dermis layer were more observable in the L salicaria group. Moreover, L. salicaria ointment individually displayed better influence on tissue oxidative stress parameters than H. scabrum and the negative control (P< 0.05). Conclusion.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of extracts and compounds from Ludwigia leptocarpa, a plant traditionally used for its vermifugal, anti-dysenteric, and antimicrobial properties. A methanol extract was prepared by maceration of the dried plant and this was successively extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain an EtOAc extract and with n-butanol to obtain an n-BuOH extract. Column chromatography of the EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts was followed by purification of different fractions, leading to the isolation of 10 known compounds. Structures of isolated compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral analysis and by comparison to structures of compounds described in the literature. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and gallic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (GAEAC) assays. Antibacterial activity was assessed with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) with respect to strains of a Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus (a major cause of community and hospital-associated infection), and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacteria, Vibrio cholerae (a cause of cholera) and Shigella flexneri (a cause of shigellosis).

The objective of this study was to identify the compounds and to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the extracts and isolated compounds from V. sinaiticum. The H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, and DEPT-135 were used to elucidate the structures of isolated compounds. Essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation method and their chemical analyses were performed by GC-MS. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity. The radical scavenging activity of the extracts and isolated compounds were evaluated using DPPH method. Silica gel column chromatographic separation of root extracts afforded seven known compounds: 3'-(4''-methoxy phenyl)-3'-oxo-propionyl hexadecanoate (1), harpagoside (2), pulverulentoside I (3), scrophuloside B4 (4), scropolioside A (5), scropolioside-D2 (6), and harpagide 6-O-beta-glucoside (7), which are all reported from this species for the first time. The EO extracts from leaves and roots were the most susceptible to Streptococcus agalactiae, with a 2 mg/mL MIC. The EO from roots was effective against Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, with a MIC of 8 mg/mL. The MeOH and CH2Cl2/CH3OH (1:1) root extracts showed the maximum activity against S. epidermidis with MIC values of 0.25 mg/mL.

This study represents the first report of the metabolomic profiling of C. volkensii by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS). The dereplication study of its secondary metabolites led to the characterization of 66 known compounds. These compounds include catecholamines, tyramine derivatives, phenolic acids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, and others. A new tyramine derivative, alongside other known compounds, was reported for the first time in the Amaranthaceae family. The new derivative and the first-reported compounds were putatively identified through MS/MS fragmentation data. Given the notorious taxonomical challenges within the genus Salsola, to which C. volkensii previously belonged, our study could offer a valuable insight into its chemical fingerprint and phylogenetic relationship to different Salsola species. The antibacterial potential of C. volkensii methanolic extract (CVM) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was screened. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CVM ranged from 32 to 256 mu g mL-1. The anti-quorum sensing potential of CVM resulted in a decrease in the percentage of strong and moderate biofilm-forming isolates from 47.83% to 17.39%. It revealed a concentration-dependent inhibitory activity on violacein formation by Chromobacterium violaceum. Moreover, CVM exhibited an in vivo protective potential against the killing capacity of P. aeruginosa isolates. A molecular docking study revealed that the quorum-sensing inhibitory effect of CVM can be attributed to the binding of tyramine conjugates, ethyl-p-digallate, and isorhamnetin to the transcriptional global activator LasR.",RSC ADVANCES,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,,PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; SECONDARY METABOLITES; ACID-AMIDES; SALSOLA; PLANT; CONSTITUENTS; EXTRACTS; FERULOYLTYRAMINE; CHENOPODIACEAE; ISOFLAVONOIDS,"[ElNaggar, Mai H.] Kafrelsheikh Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacognosy, Kafrelsheikh 33516, Egypt; [Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan] Deraya Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacognosy, New Minia 61111, Egypt; [Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan] Minia Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacognosy, Al Minya 61519, Egypt; [Bar, Fatma M.

These pathogens cause systemic candidiasis, a significant cause of mortality in immune-compromised patients. ABC transporters of the pleiotropic drug resistance subfamily, such as Cdr1p of C. albicans, play an important role in antifungal resistance and are potential bioassay targets for antifungal therapies against drug-resistant pathogens. We observed strong antifungal growth inhibitory activity in the methanol extract of Dalea formosa roots. This extract afforded six new isoflavonoids, sedonans. A-F (1-6), a new but-2-enolide, 4'-O-methylpuerol A (7), and the new pterocarpan entsandwicensin (8). The structures and absolute configurations of these compounds were assigned using spectroscopic and chiroptical techniques. The direct antifungal activity of 1 against C glabrata (MIC = 20 mu M) was higher than that of fluconazole. Sedonans A-F and ent-sandwicensin were also active against Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that express differing ABC transporter-associated resistance mechanisms but differed in their susceptibility to Cdr1p-mediated detoxification. A sedonan A (1)/ent-sandwicensin (8) combination exhibited synergistic growth inhibition.

Off-line high-pressure liquid chromatography activity-based profiling of this extract enabled a precise localization of the compounds responsible for the antifungal activity that were isolated and identified as the known compounds flindersine (17) and 8-methoxyflindersine (18). As well as the identification of the bioactive principles, the ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolite profiling of the dichloromethane stem bark fraction allowed the detection of more than 1000 components. Some of these could be assigned putatively to secondary metabolites previously isolated from the family Rutaceae. Generation of a molecular network based on MS2 spectra indicated the presence of indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloids and related scaffolds. Efficient targeted isolation of these compounds was performed by geometric transfer of the analytical high-pressure liquid chromatography profiling conditions to preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography. This yielded six new indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloids (5, 16, 19-22) that were assigned structurally. The medium-pressure liquid chromatography separations afforded additionally 16 other compounds.

This study compares amount of total phenolics in seeds and microgreens followed by the optimization of ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) of free and bound phenolics from two varieties (VL-324 and VL-352) of Eleusine coracana (Finger millet) using response surface methodology. A Box-Behnken design for recovery of total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH center dot and ABTS(+) radical scavenging was used. The optimized conditions for extracting free phenolics from VL-324 and VL-352 varieties were 50 min, 45.11% methanol and 10 ml/g solvent to matter (S/M) ratio, and 60 min, 49.86% methanol and 16.69 ml/g S/M, whereas bound phenolics were 60 min, 1.65 M NaOH and 26.38 ml/g S/M, and 97 min, 1 M NaOH and 26.53 ml/g S/M, respectively. Free TPC was comparable in both varieties whereas, antioxidant activity was higher in VL-352 extract. Bound TPC and antioxidant activity were higher in VL-352 variety. UPLC-MS/MS revealed ferulic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in free and bound forms. Comparing with conventional solvent extraction (CSE) revealed UAE yielded higher TPC and excellent antioxidant activity. Bound phenolics extracts displayed substantial antibacterial activity against opportunistic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Cronobacter sakazakii) with lower MIC (0.125 mu g/ml) against Gram-negative bacteria with more complex cell walls.

The current paper is aimed at providing an overview of uses, toxicology, pharmacological properties and phytochemistry of Z. mucronata. The information used in the current work was retrieved using various search engines, including Pubmed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scielo, SciFinder and Scopus. The key words used included Ziziphus mucronata, secondary metabolites, chemistry, biological activity and pharmacology, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, ethnobotanical survey, medicinal uses, safety, toxicology and other related words. Out of the 46 infections which the plant species is used to treat, the most common uses includes sexually transmitted infections, skin infections, diarrhoea and dysentery, respiratory and chest complaints and gynaecological complaints (citations >= 6). Pharmacologically, the plant species exhibited a potential antimicrobial activity yielding a minimum inhibitory concentration of <1 mg/ml against important pathogens which includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans, Cryptoccoos neoformans amongst other microorganisms. Furthermore, the extracts and compounds from Z mucronata revealed potent antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other activities in vitro. Phytochemically, cyclo-peptide alkaloids (commonly called mucronines) dominates and in conjunction with triterpenes, flavonoids, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. Besides these compounds, the plant species exhibited the presence of important in minerals. These phytoconstituents may well explain the reported biological activities. Although the extracts revealed no cytotoxic effect to Vero cells, further toxicological characteristics of the plant species still needs to be explored. There is also a need to carry out the comprehensive safety profiles of the plant species, including heavy metal detection. Although the plant species revealed important biological activities, which includes antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-plasmodial, anthelmintic, and anti-anaemic activity in vitro, further research is needed to explore the in vivo studies, other compounds responsible for such activities and the mechanisms of action thereof. Such activities validates the use of the plant species in traditional medicine. The data on the possible use of the plant species in the treatment of diarrhoea, sexually transmitted infections, skin related and gynaecological complaints are scant and still needs to be explored and validated both in vitro and in vivo.

A number of triterpene glycosides show membranolytic activity, and, therefore, are considered to be promising antimicrobial drugs. However, the interrelation between their structure, biological activities, and target membrane lipid composition remains elusive. Here we studied the antifungal effects of four Panax triterpene glycosides (ginsenosides) with sugar moieties at the C-3 (ginsenosides Rg3, Rh2), C-20 (compound K), and both (ginsenoside F2) positions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants with altered sterol plasma membrane composition. We observed reduced cytostatic activity of the Rg3 and compound K in the UPC2-1 strain with high membrane sterol content. Moreover, LAM gene deletion reduced yeast resistance to Rg3 and digitonin, another saponin with glycosylated aglycon in the C-3 position. LAM genes encode plasma membraneanchored StARkin superfamily-member sterol transporters. We also showed that the deletion of the ERG6 gene that inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis at the stage of zymosterol increased the cytostatic effects of Rg3 and Rh2, but not the other two tested ginsenosides. At the same time, in silico simulation revealed that the substitution of ergosterol with zymosterol in the membrane changes the spatial orientation of Rg3 and Rh2 in the membranes. These results imply that the plasma membrane sterol composition defines its interaction with triterpene glycoside depending on their glycoside group position. Our results also suggest that the biological role of membraneanchored StARkin family protein is to protect eukaryotic cells from triterpenes glycosylated at the C-3 position.",BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES,ELSEVIER,Sterol -binding proteins; Ginsenosides; Ergostereol; Membrane -anchored StARkin; Sterol transport; Zymosterol,ERGOSTEROL BIOSYNTHESIS; RESISTANCE; SAPONINS; MEMBRANES; REPRESSION; INDUCTION; MECHANISM; PROTEINS; DYNAMICS; MUTANTS,"[Sokolov, Svyatoslav S.; Severin, Fedor F.; Knorre, Dmitry A.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Dept Mol Energet Microorganisms, Leninskie Gory 1-40, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Volynsky, Pavel E.] Russian Acad Sci, Shemyakin Ovchinnikov Inst Bioorgan Chem, Lab Biomol Modeling, Miklukho Maklaya Str 16-10, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Zangieva, Olga T.] Minist Healthcare Russian Federat, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Natl Med & Surg Ctr, Nizhnyaya Pervomayskaya Str 70, Moscow 105203, Russia; [Glagoleva, Elena S.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Biol, Leninskie Gory 1-12, Moscow 119991, Russia","Panax, Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"Araliaceae, Apiaceae",,"noise, noise, triterpenoids, triterpenoids, saponins","noise, noise, triterpenoids, triterpenoids, saponins",,,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Panax, Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Araliaceae, Apiaceae","Panax, Saccharomyces",Russia

Results of LC-MS/MS analysis showed high contents of gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate and catechin, and significant amounts of quercetin-3-O-galactoside and quercetin-3-O-glucoside. Evaluation of the antifungal properties revealed that POM induced notable growth inhibition of Alternaria alternata (34.3%), Penicillium spp. (30.6%), Fusarium semitectum (20.2%) and Aspergillus spp. (19.6%). Evaluation of cytotoxicity against human hepatoma HepG2 cells included monitoring the effects of both POM alone and its combination with cytostatic doxorubicin (Dox). Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution and the expression of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide-dismutases SOD1 and SOD2 and catalase) were determined. A dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was detected, but a remarkably stronger effect was obtained when POM and Dox were applied in combination as compared to individual treatments. IC50 values were determined to be 393 mu g/mL (POM) and 2.24 mu g/mL (Dox) in combination, but 1153 mu g/mL (POM) and 12.56 mu g/mL (Dox) in a single treatment. The value of the Loewe index, determined for IC50, was notably lower than 1 (LI=0.51), clearly indicating synergism of POM and Dox.

Seem. 1868 (Araliaceae) are related to presence of over 150 secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, sterols, polysaccharides, terpenoid saponins and terpenoid acids, though the main biologically active substances of A. elata are saponins and flavonoids. Some clinical tests and experimental studies have proved the influence ofA. elata on the organism through increase in physical work capacity, exerting an anti-stress effect against a broad range of harmful factors, including stress from cold, immobilization, ultraviolet radiation and low pressure. The literature also reports the anti-ulcer, anti-secretory, antifungal, anti-tumour, and antimicrobial activity of preparations from this plant. In our laboratory experiment, we determined that ethanolic tincture ofA. elata has no effect on the intensity of growth of body weight of young rats against the background of excessive content of fat in their diet Excessive fat-feeding of male rats leads mostly to disorders in the functioning of the liver and development of steatosis. This was accompanied by reduction in relative mass of the liver, increase in activity of hepatic enzymes, dysproteinemia, increase in the level of bilimbin and decrease in the level of urea. Additional use of 0.1% ethanol led to impaired functioning of the kidneys, reduction of their relative mass, signs of dehydration, increase in the level of creatinine and total calcium in the blood. Use of ethanolic tincture ofA. elata mitigates negative excess of fat, is accompanied by normalization of indices of mass of the organs, less notable dysproteinemia, impairment in the level of creatinine, glucose, urea, cholesterol, bilimbin and total calcium. Ethanolic tincture of A. elata has a low immunosuppressive action, against the background of a high fat diet it leads to increase in the amount of typical Escherichia coli, decrease in Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacter spp , significant decrease and in high concentrations (0.1% ethanolic tincture of A. elata) elimination of bacteria of Clostridium and Klebsiella genera, and also various yeast fungi in the intestine. In the examined male rats, against the background of excess of fat in the diet, no serious changes in the composition of the normal gut microbiota (Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Proteus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Candida spp.) was observed, nor were any lactosenegative enterobacteria (Citrobacter genus) found.

In particular, hydroethanolic extracts obtained via an ultrasonic-assisted extraction technique were selected for antimicrobial tests. The extracts were screened for their antibacterial effects against foodborne pathogens that were both Gram-positive, in the case of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative, in the case of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, showing variable bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. In addition, our results demonstrated that the tested grape pomace extracts can reduce the inhibitory concentration of standard antibiotics. Interestingly, selected extracts inhibited biofilm development by S. aureus and B. cereus.

Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was used to extract saponins from chickpea (Cicer arietinum). Several MAE conditions were tested, and the method proved to be superior to Soxhlet extraction with regard to amounts of solvents required, time and energy expended. The use of a butanol/H2O mixture showed selectivity towards saponin extraction. Using TLC, two distinct saponins were observed in the various chickpea extracts. The identification of the major saponin as a DDMP-conjugated saponin was verified using H-1 and C-13 NMR, for the first time in chickpea. The MAE procedure most likely contributed to the conservation of the heat-sensitive DDMP moiety. The pure chickpea saponin exhibited significant inhibitory activity against Penicillium digitatum and additional filamentous fungi. Two Fusarium strains tested were highly tolerant to the saponin. The potential for using MAE for the efficient extraction of natural products may assist in expediting the chemical analysis and characterization of the biological activities of such compounds.

G. glabra, G. inflata, and G. uralensis spent extracts showed distinct phytochemical profiles. Antibacterial activity (Lactobacillus buchneri, Streptococcus mutans, and Staphylococcus aureus) of G. uralensis and G. inflata (MICs 25-250 mu g mL(-1)) was higher than of G. glabra (MICs 75-1000 mu g mL(-1)).

Total phenolic acids (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) of the different date pits were measured using a Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. Different organic solvents [(n-hexane; H2O: EtOH (1:1); ethyl acetate; acetone: Water (1:1); and methanol: Chloroform (1:1)] were compared to evaluate the phytotoxicity of Ajwa, Fard, Khalas, Khodari, Abu Maan, Lulu, and Mabroom date pits. The antimicrobial activity of the date pit extracts were evaluated by means of agar-well diffusion assay on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29123), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Candida albicans (ATCC 66027). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured following clinical laboratory standardization institute (CLSI) protocol. The biochemical analyses of date pits indicate that TPC were ranged from 7.80 mg of equivalent gallic acid/100 g dry weight in Ajwa to 4.65 mg in Mabroom. The TFC were ranged between 1.6-4.54 mg of equivalent catechin/100 g dry weight. Ajwa pit extract showed good quality traits (higher protein, lower ash content, and intermediate dietary fiber). The results indicate that the ethyl acetate extract of Khalas and Khodari inhibited S. aureus with an inhibition zone diameter of 20 mm and MIC of 10 mg/mL. Abu Mann pit extract inhibited the S. aureus and also decreased the population of E. coli. The diameter of inhibition zone was 15, 16, and 18 mm after treatment with Ajwa extracts, while the MICs were 7.5 and 5 mg/mL.

Zhang is one of the most cultivated wild species for its ornamental, medicinal, and edible oil values. However, the biochemical composition and biological activities of hydrolate extracts from P. ostii are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the potentials of various P. ostii organs for being used as anti-bacterial agents. The single-factor optimization and Box-Behnken Design (BBD) experiments were performed to determine the optimal hydrosol extraction conditions as follows: extraction duration of 4 h, temperature of 90 degrees C, pressure of 0.35 MPa, and ratio of 6:1. In total, 150 volatile chemicals were identified and quantified from P. ostii through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activities against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial were examined. Among the volatile substances, mono-terpenoids (31.36-77.28 %) was of the highest content in P.ostii, followed by alcohols (17.69-26.82 %). The quantitative test demonstrated the P. ostii hydrosols being significantly effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus hemolytis-beta. In particular, the newly-grown leaf hydrosols displayed more pronounced antibacterial effects than those from other organ, with the inhibition zones and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) being 10.65-17.5 mm and 0.78-12.5 mg/mL, respectively. The results indicate that the hydrolate extracts from P. ostii possessed remarkable antibacterial activities against some common skin-infecting and food-borne bacterial pathogens, implying that P. ostii could be a potential source for antibacterial agents for food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics.",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,ELSEVIER,Paeonia ostii; Hydrolate extract; GC-MS; Secondary metabolite; Antibacterial activity,ESSENTIAL OILS; POLYSACCHARIDE EXTRACTION; PAEONIFLORIN; PURIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; BACTERIA; PLASMA,"[Xin, Ziwei; Yang, Weizong; Wang, Wenjia; Niu, Lixin; Sun, Daoyang; Zhang, Yanlong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Arts, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Xin, Ziwei; Yang, Weizong; Wang, Wenjia; Niu, Lixin; Sun, Daoyang; Zhang, Yanlong] Natl Forestry Adm, Oil Peony Engn Technol Res Ctr, Yangling 712100, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Duan, Yihao] Shanxi Univ, Dept Foreign Languages, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi, Peoples R China",Paeonia ostii,,Paeoniaceae,,"noise, terpenoids","noise, terpenoids",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,,Paeonia ostii,Paeoniaceae,Paeonia,China

In this study, we isolated six isopentenyl flavonoids (1-6) from the roots of S. flavescens and evaluated their activities against phytopathogenic fungi. In vitro activities showed that kurarinone and sophoraflavanone G displayed broad spectrum and superior activities, among which sophoraflavanone G displayed excellent activity against tested fungi, with EC50 values ranging from 4.76 to 13.94 mu g/mL. Notably, kurarinone was easily purified and showed potential activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium graminearum with EC50 values of 16.12, 16.55, and 16.99 mu g/mL, respectively. Consequently, we initially investigated the mechanism of kurarinone against B. cinerea. It was found that kurarinone disrupted cell wall components, impaired cell membrane integrity, increased cell membrane permeability, and affected cellular energy metabolism, thereby exerting its effect against B. cinerea.

Peels and Seeds,"Due to the growing awareness of Punica granatum fruit's health-promoting properties, the pomegranate is increasingly used for food purposes. This results in the formation of biological waste products such as peels. A biowaste circular bioeconomy strategy holds great prospective for a sustainable economy. Therefore, a sustainable and environmentally friendly way of disposing of waste (e.g., use of biowaste to obtain high-value components (e.g., punicalagins, enzymes)) is crucial for the protection of the environment and human health. In the presented study, the content of total phenols and proanthocyanidins in ten samples of Punica granatum fruit (juice, aqueous (H2O) and ethanolic (EtOH) extracts of peels and seeds) was determined. Peel extracts were found to be the richest in the content of secondary metabolites and showed extremely high antioxidant potential (approximately 90% inhibition: DPPH radical scavenging activity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study to determine the enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase, lipase, peroxidase, protease, and transglutaminase in different P. granatum samples. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of all P. granatum samples was qualitatively determined against three strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) and three strains of Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria, susceptible to gaining antibiotic resistance. Moreover, the most promising peel extracts were quantified for antibacterial efficacy against tested bacteria at five different concentrations. All samples slowed down and inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria. MIC90 values (2.7 or 0.3 mg/mL) were determined in 18 out of 24 experiments (four samples, six bacteria tested). There is no research in the reviewed literature that is current with such detailed and comprehensive determination of P. granatum peel extracts antibacterial activity.

Initially, extraction and fractionation of the selected medicinal plant were carried out, followed by phytochemical qualitative tests, which were mostly positive for all the extracts. EtOAc fraction possessed a significant amount of phenolic (79.2 +/- 0.30 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (84.0 +/- 0.39 mg QE/g) content. The EtOAc fraction of S. edelbergii exhibited appreciable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) strains and significant zones of inhibition were observed against Gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus). However, it was found inactive against Candida Albicans and Fusarium oxysporum fungal strains. The chloroform fraction was the most effective with an IC50 value of 172 and 74 mu g/mL against DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) and ABTS assays, in comparison with standard ascorbic acid 59 and 63 mu g/mL, respectively.

In the search for new plant-derived compounds with antimicrobial activities, two alkaloid extracts obtained from bulbs and leaves of Pancratium illyricum L., a plant of the Amarillydaceae family, were tested for their effect on bacterial and yeast growth. Methods: The broth microdilution susceptibility test was applied to study the effect of plant extracts on the growth of reference bacterial strains and Candida albicans reference and clinical isolates strains. Extracts obtained from the different parts of the plant were tested and compared with the pure components identified in the extracts. Since matrix metalloproteinase enzymes play a role in the dissemination process of Candida albicans, the effect of the bulb extract and pure alkaloids on in vitro collagenase activity was tested. Cell viability test was carried out on human embryo lung fibroblasts (HEL 299). Results: Whilst both extracts did not show any inhibitory activity against neither Gram positive nor Gram negative bacteria, a strong antifungal activity was detected, in particular for the bulb extract. All clinical isolates were susceptible to the growth inhibitory activity of the bulb extract, with endpoint IC50 values ranging from 1.22 to 78 mu g/mL. The pure alkaloids lycorine and vittatine, identified as components of the extract, were also assayed for their capacity of inhibiting the yeast growth, and lycorine turned very active, with endpoint IC50 values ranging from 0.89 to 28.5 mu g/mL. A potent inhibition of the in vitro collagenase activity was found in the presence of the bulb extract, and this effect was much higher than that exerted by the pure alkaloids. Viability of cell lines tested was not affected by the extract.

G. Hartley from the Rutaceae family is one of the richest sources of plant secondary metabolites, including coumarins and flavanoids. This study investigates the free radical scavenging and antibacterial activities of M. glabra and its isolated compounds. M. glabra ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were prepared using the cold maceration technique. The isolation of compounds was performed with column chromatography. The free radical scavenging activity of the extracts and isolated compounds were evaluated based on their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) activities. The extracts and compounds were also subjected to antibacterial evaluation using bio-autographic and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) techniques against two oral pathogens, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans. Isolation of phytoconstituents from ethyl acetate extract successfully yielded quercetin 3, 5, 3'-trimethyl ether (1) and kumatakenin (2), while the isolation of the methanol extract resulted in scoparone (3), 6, 7, 8-trimethoxycoumarin (4), marmesin (5), glabranin (6), umbelliferone (7), scopoletin (8), and sesamin (9). The study is the first to isolate compound (1) from Rutaceae plants, and also the first to report the isolation of compounds (2-5) from M. glabra. The ORAC evaluation showed that the methanol extract is stronger than the ethyl acetate extract, while umbelliferone (7) exhibited the highest ORAC value of 24 965 mu molTE/g followed by glabranin (6), sesamin (9) and scopoletin (8). Ethyl acetate extract showed stronger antibacterial activity towards E. faecalis and S. mutans than the methanol extract with MIC values of 4166.7 +/- 1443.4 mu g/ml and 8303.3 +/- 360.8 mu g/ml respectively. Ethyl acetate extract inhibited E. faecalis growth, as shown by the lowest optical density value of 0.046 at a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL with a percentage inhibition of 95%.

Despite the extensive literature focusing on identifying novel antibacterial metabolites, little work has been undertaken to examine variation in levels of antibacterial activity in any plant species. Here, we used large-scale sampling of leaves of the antibacterial plant, wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.), assembling a set of tissue extracts from 168 plants, with 504 leaves collected and analysed. We assayed extracts for antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and used LC-MS to carry out a chemometric analysis examining variation in individual metabolites, comparing them with several ecological parameters. We found that allicin was the only metabolite which was positively related to antibacterial activity. Soil temperature was a key determinant of variability in the concentrations of many foliar metabolites, however, neither allicin concentrations nor antibacterial activity was related to any of our measured ecological parameters, other than roadside proximity. We suggest that the synthesis of allicin precursors may be largely independent of growing conditions. This may be to ensure that allicin is synthesised rapidly and in sufficiently high concentrations to effectively prevent herbivory and pest damage. This finding contrasts with flavonoids which were found to vary greatly between plants and across sites. Our findings suggest that key biologically active metabolites are constrained in their concentration range compared to other compounds in the metabolome.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the crude extract, fractions, and some isolated secondary metabolites from the leaves of Macaranga occidentalis, a Cameroonian medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of microbial infections. Repeated column chromatography of the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions led to the isolation of seventeen previously known compounds (1-17), among which three steroids (1-3), one triterpene (4), four flavonoids (5-8), two stilbenoids (9 and 10) four ellagic acid derivatives (11-14), one geraniinic acid derivative (15), one coumarine (16), and one glyceride (17). Their structures were elucidated mainly by means of extensive spectroscopic and spectrometric (1D and 2D NMR and, MS) analysis and comparison with the published data. The crude extract, fractions, and isolated compounds were all screened for their antimicrobial activity. None of the natural compounds was active against Candida strains. However, the crude extract, fractions, and compounds showed varying levels of antibacterial properties against at least one of the tested bacterial strains, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 250 to 1000 mu g/mL. The n-butanol (n-BuOH) fraction was the most active against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, with an MIC value of 250 mu g/mL. Among the isolated compounds, schweinfurthin B (10) exhibited the best activity against Staphylococcus aureus NR 46003 with a MIC value of 62.5 mu g/mL. In addition, schweinfurthin O (9) and isomacarangin (6) also exhibited moderate activity against the same strain with a MIC value of 125 mu g/mL. Therefore, pharmacomodulation was performed on compound 6 and three new semisynthetic derivatives (6a-c) were prepared by allylation and acetylation reactions and screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. None of the semisynthetic derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against the same tested strains.

The antioxidant potential of extracts was evaluated through DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging, oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays, and the antibacterial activity was tested against food spoilage bacteria: Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Brochothrix thermosphacta. Of all seaweed extracts, A.nodosum exhibited the highest phenolic and carotenoid contents, 50.2mg GAE/g and 85g/g, respectively. A.nodosum also displayed the best DPPH scavenging activity, EC50 10.4g/mL, and best capacity to reduce ferric ion, 677.2molTE/g dry weight at a concentration of 100g/mL. U.lactuca extracts showed the highest growth inhibition of E.coli, 69.5%; M.luteus, 61.4%; and B.thermosphacta, 21.4%. These findings suggest a high potential of St. Lawrence Estuary seaweed extracts for application in the food industry. Practical ApplicationsFood producers, food industries, governments and consumers are aware of the importance to look into effective preventive measures in food quality and food safety fields. The decay of foods is caused by physical, chemical and biological factors, which leads to the loss of the organoleptic characteristics and consumer safety. Natural extracts combining both antioxidant and antibacterial activities can be used for further applications in reducing food spoilage and prolonging food shelf life. The majority of natural extracts could be approved as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). St. Lawrence Estuary seaweed extracts possess high potential for application in the food industry using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) method, which was selected for extraction efficiency purposes. In addition, production of seaweeds extracts using approved food-grade ethanol solvent by PLE method involves, on an industrial scale, cost savings.",JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY,WILEY,,HIMANTHALIA-ELONGATA; ULVA-LACTUCA; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; EXTRACTS; CAPACITY; ASSAY; POWER; DPPH; FRAP,"[Boisvert, Catherine; Beaulieu, Lucie; Bonnet, Claudie] Univ Laval, Dept Food & Nutr Sci, Inst Nutr & Funct Foods INAF, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Boisvert, Catherine; Pelletier, Emilien] Univ Quebec, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Beaulieu, Lucie; Bonnet, Claudie] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chem & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",lactuca,,Asteraceae,,"phenolics, carotenoid","phenolics, carotenoid","Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus","negative, positive",,lactuca,Asteraceae,Lactuca,Canada

Miang, known as chewing tea, is produced from Camellia sinensis var. assamica or Assam tea leaves fermentation. Previous studies revealed that the extract of Miang contains various phenolic and flavonoid compounds with numerous biological activities including antibacterial activity. However, the antibacterial activity of Miang against XDR bacteria especially colistin-resistant strains had not been investigated. In this study, the compositions of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in fresh, steamed, and fermented Assam tea leaves were examined by HPLC, and their antibacterial activities were evaluated by the determination of the MIC and MBC. Pyrogallol was detected only in the extract from Miang and showed the highest activities with an MIC of 0.25 mg/mL and an MBC of 0.25-0.5 mg/mL against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, colistin-resistant E. coli, and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae. The effects on morphology and proteomic changes in K. pneumoniae NH54 treated with Miang extract were characterized by SEM and label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics analysis. The results revealed that Miang extract caused the decrease in bacterial cell wall integrity and cell lysis. The up- and downregulated expression with approximately a 2 to >5-fold change in proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and outer membrane, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism were identified. These findings suggested that Miang containing pyrogallol and other secondary metabolites from fermentation has potential as an alternative candidate with an antibacterial agent or natural active pharmaceutical ingredient against XDR bacteria including colistin-resistant bacteria.",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,MDPI,Miang extract; proteomic analysis; extensively drug-resistant bacteria; antibacterial activity; pyrogallol,ESCHERICHIA-COLI; COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM; POLYMYXIN RESISTANCE; PICKLED TEA; IDENTIFICATION; GENES; ACID,"[Anek, Pannita; Kumpangcum, Sutita; Phannachet, Kulwadee] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Roytrakul, Sittiruk] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Khanongnuch, Chartchai; Saenjum, Chalermpong; Phannachet, Kulwadee] Chiang Mai Univ, Res Ctr Innovat Analyt Sci & Technol Biodivers Bas, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Khanongnuch, Chartchai; Saenjum, Chalermpong; Phannachet, Kulwadee] Chiang Mai Univ, Res Ctr Multidisciplinary Approaches Miang, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Saenjum, Chalermpong] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Kle,"Klebsiella pneumoniae, Camellia sinensis",,", Theaceae","phenolics, flavonoids, noise","phenolics, flavonoids, noise","Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae","positive, negative, negative",,"Klebsiella pneumoniae, Camellia sinensis",", Theaceae","Klebsiella, Camellia",Thailand

Methods: E. elatior flowers grown in three different locations of Malaysia (Kelantan, Pahang and Johor), were investigated for differences in their content of secondary metabolites (total phenolics [TPC], total flavonoids [TFC], and total tannin content [TTC]) as well as for their antioxidant, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. Phenolic acids and flavonoids were isolated and identified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activities. The anticancer activity of extracts was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Results: When extracted with various solvents (aqueous and ethanolic), samples from the different locations yielded significantly different results for TPC, TFC, and TTC as well as antioxidant activity. Aqueous extracts of E. elatior flowers collected from Kelantan exhibited the highest values: TPC (618.9 mg/100 g DM), TFC (354.2 mg/100 g DM), TTC (129.5 mg/100 g DM), DPPH (76.4 %), and FRAP (6.88 mM of Fe (II)/g) activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 34.5 mu g/mL compared with extracts of flowers collected from the other two locations. The most important phenolic compounds isolated in this study, based on concentration, were: gallic acid > caffeic acid > tannic acid > chlorogenic acid; and the most important flavonoids were: quercetin > apigenin > kaempferol > luteolin > myricetin. Extracts of flowers from Kelantan exhibited potent anticancer activity with a IC(50)of 173.1 and 196.2 mu g/mL against the tumor cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 respectively, compared with extracts from Pahang (IC50 = 204.5 and 246.2 mu g/mL) and Johor samples (IC50 = 277.1 and 296.7 mu g/mL). Extracts of E. elatior flowers also showed antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 30 to > 100 mu g/mL.

Ginkgo biloba, a tree native to China, has been spread around the world as an ornamental tree. Its seeds have been used as snacks and medical materials in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), while over the last century its leaf extracts emerged as a source of rising pharmaceutical commerce related to brain health in Western medicine. Besides studies on the neuroprotective effects of Ginkgo, its antibacterial activities have gained more attention from researchers in the past decades, though its leaves were the main focus. We reviewed a 16th-century Chinese text, the Ben Cao Gang Mu by Li Shi-Zhen, to investigate the ancient prescription of Ginkgo seeds for skin infections. We performed antibacterial assays on various Ginkgo seed extracts against pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Cutibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baurnannii; Streptococcus pyogenes) relevant to skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). We demonstrate here that Ginkgo seed coats and immature seeds exhibit antibacterial activity against Grampositive skin pathogens (C. acnes, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes), and thus validated its use in TCM.

Their resistance to salinization is due, among other things, to their high ability to detoxify free radicals, owing to the relatively high content of antioxidants. On the coast of the Baltic Sea and in the lagoons, there are several rare halophyte species included in the Red Book of the Kaliningrad Region (Russia) and the Baltic region, such as Spergularia marina (L.) Griseb. and Glaux maritima L. The aim of the research was to study the accumulation of certain groups of phenolic compounds in different parts of S. marina and G. maritima plants under conditions of weak and strong soil salinity, as well as to analyze the antioxidant, antibacterial, and fungicidal activity of extracts of the studied plant species. The present study showed an increase in total phenolic content in the roots and shoots of S. marina, and the shoots of G. maritima, in response to increased soil salinity. At the same time, the total content of flavonoids in all the studied parts of the two plant species remained unchanged. However, the content of individual flavonoids (hesperetin, epicatechin, apigenin derivative, luteolin derivative) in S. marina increased, for G. maritima there was a tendency to reduce the content of flavonoids in roots and shoots with an increase in soil salinity. There was an increase in the total content of hydroxycinnamic acids in the roots of Glaux maritima, as well as an increase in the content of protocatechuic acid in the roots and shoots of Spergularia marina. A positive relationship was established between the antioxidant activity of S. marina root extracts and the total content of phenolic compounds, as well as G. maritima shoots extracts and the total content of phenolic compounds. Extracts of S. marina showed no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and weak fungicidal activity of stem extracts and inflorescences grown on soils, with high levels of salinities, was detected against Candida albicans.

Herein, it is demonstrated how combining untargeted metabolomics with synergy directed fractionation can be effective toward accomplishing this goal. To demonstrate this approach, an extract of the botanical goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) was fractionated and tested for its ability to enhance the antimicrobial activity of the alkaloid berberine (4) against the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Bioassay data were combined with untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data sets (biochemometrics) to produce selectivity ratio (SR) plots, which visually show which extract components are most strongly associated with the biological effect. Using this approach, the new flavonoid 3,3'-dihydroxy-5,7,4'-trimethoxy-6,8-C-dimethylflavone (29) was identified, as were several flavonoids known to be active.

Chr. with bactericidal and cytotoxic prospects,"Xanthones C-glycosides are plants secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities. Among the C-glycoside xanthones, the mangiferin (MF) is of widespread occurrence in plants while isomangiferin (IsoMF) is not very common. For the present study mangiferin (MF) and isomangiferin (IsoMF) were isolated from Dryopteris ramosa. The antibacterial potential of MF and IsoMF was evaluated by using agar well diffusion method while cytotoxic properties of MF and IsoMF were assessed by brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT). The antibacterial potential of MF and IsoMF increases in dose dependent manner. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) indicated strong antibacterial potential of MF against Salmonella setubal (125 mg/mL) and Bacillus subtilis (125 mg/mL) while MF showed weak antibacterial potential against Escherichia coli (500 mg/mL). On the other hand the IsoMF showed better antibacterial potential against all the tested strain including Escherichia coli (MIC = 250 mg/mL). The MF and IsoMF showed poor cytotoxicity towards Brine shrimp nauplii as indicated by their LD50 (969.77 +/- 0.67 and 768.92 +/- 0.81 mg/ mL respectively). The present study has highlighted the antibacterial potential of MF and IsoMF. Further evaluation of these two isomeric compounds may prove to be the future remedies for various bacterial infections and other human ailments. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Y. R. Ling extracts. Methods: Extracts of aerial parts were prepared by successive extraction (n-hexane {Sk-nH}, ethyl acetate {Sk-EA}, methanol {Sk-M} and aqueous {Sk-Aq}). Chromogenic assays determined the antioxidant profile while HPLC quantified several polyphenols. Agar well diffusion was employed for antimicrobial potential while brine shrimp and hemolytic assays established the biosafety profile. Results: The results have shown that maximum extract recovery (17.49% w/w), total phenolics content (24.44 +/- 0.15 lg GAE/mgE), and total flavonoids content (6.87 +/- 0.25 lg QE/mgE) were recorded in Sk-Aq. RP-HPLC quantified a significant amount of syringic acid (1.43 +/- 0.05 mg/mgE), caffeic acid (0.48 +/- 0.02 mg/mgE), gentisic acid (6.44 +/- 0.01 mg/mgE), and quercetin (4.3 9 +/- 0.01 mg/mgE) in Sk-Aq, while maximum amounts of thymoquinone (0.21 +/- 0.02 mg/mgE) and luteolin (3.90 +/- 0.03 mg/mgE) along with apigenin (3.72 +/- 0.03 mg/mgE) existed in Sk-M and highest quantities of ferulic acid (2.98 +/- 0.01 mg/mgE), myricetin (1.04 +/- 0.02 mg/mgE) and kaempferol (1.23 +/- 0.01 mg/mgE) were found to be present in Sk-EA. A substantial free radical scavenging (85.87 +/- 1.00%), total reducing power (211.93 +/- 0.97 mg AAE/mgE), and urease inhibition activity (87.99 +/- 0.19% at 500 mg/ml) were also recorded in the Sk-Aq. The highest antioxidant capacity (243.5 +/- 1.12 mg AAE/mgE), antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity (100% reduction in plaque formation at 400 mg/ml) were observed for Sk-EA. Maximum antibacterial and antifungal activities were revealed against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC = 25 +/- 0.37 mg/ml), and Candida albicans (MIC = 50 +/- 0.19 mg/ml) respectively. The prominent antidiabetic potential was displayed by Sk-nH in terms of a-amylase and a-glucosidase inhibition.

Three lettuce cultivars, namely, Pazmanea RZ (green butterhead, V1), Hawking RZ (green multi-leaf lettuce, V2), and Barlach RZ (red multi-leaf, V3) were subjected to two S-treatments in the form of magnesium sulfate (+S) or magnesium chloride (-S). Significant differences were observed under -S treatments, especially among V1 and V2 lettuce cultivars. These responses were reflected in the yield, levels of macro- and micro-nutrients, water-soluble sugars, and free inorganic anions. In comparison with the green cultivars (V1 and V2), the red-V3 cultivar revealed a greater acclimation to S starvation, as evidenced by relative higher plant growth. In contrast, the green cultivars showed higher capabilities in production and superior quality attributes under +S condition. As for secondary metabolites, sixteen compounds (e.g., sesquiterpene lactones, caffeoyl derivatives, caffeic acid hexose, 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-OCQA), quercetin and luteolin glucoside derivatives) were annotated in all three cultivars with the aid of HPLC-DAD-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Sesquiterpene lactone lactucin and anthocyanin cyanidin 3-O-galactoside were only detected in V1 and V3 cultivars, respectively. Based on the analyses, the V3 cultivar was the most potent radical scavenger, while V1 and V2 cultivars exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus in response to S provision.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the extract, fractions, and some secondary metabolites isolated from the leaves of Crinum glaucum A. Chev. (Amaryllidaceae). The antibacterial activities were performed with the ethanol (EtOH) extract, as well as with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (n-BuOH) fractions. Repeated column chromatography of the fractions led to the isolation of several compounds and their structures were elucidated mainly by means of extensive spectroscopic analysis [(one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry)] and the comparison with published data. This includes eleven alkaloids: (3S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (1), lycorine (2), ungeremine (3), ambelline (4), macronine (5), 5,6-dihydrobicolorine (6), trisphaeridine (7), hippadine (8), adenosine (9), arolycoricidine (10), pratorimine (11); two steroids: beta-sitosterol (12), beta-sitosterol-3-O-beta-D glucopyranoside (14) and one triterpene: oleanolic acid (13). Apart from lycorine (2), all these secondary metabolites are isolated from C. glaucum for the first time. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the EtOH extract, and the n-BuOH and EtOAc fractions as well as compounds 2, 3, 6 and 9 against pathogenic bacteria was performed. All extracts and fractions showed varying levels of antibacterial properties against at least one of the bacteria strains tested. The n-BuOH fraction was the most active extract with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 mu g/mL against Enterococcus faecalis. For pure compounds, the best MIC (8 mu g/mL) was obtained with ungeremine (3) against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The Fusarium oxysporum complex (sensu lato) is one of the most dangerous groups of phytopathogenic fungi, causing the death of conifer species, including Pinus sylvestris seedlings in forest and ornamental nurseries. Recently, non-chemical methods of plant protection have become the basis of integrated pest management (IPM) in the European Union (EC Directive). The possibility of protection of pine seedlings against the pathogen F. oxysporum using active substances from wood-destroying fungi commonly found in forests was examined. Methanolic extracts of Fomitopsis pinicola, Ganoderma applanatum, and Trametes versicolor were found to contain substances effective in both prevention and treatment of infected seedlings. G. applanatum and T. versicolor showed particular biological activity in increasing plant resistance. Efficacy, especially of the extract of F. pinicola, increased with concentration.

L. concentrates its diversity in Mexico. Among the secondary metabolites that can be isolated from organic its extracts are flavonoids and lignans. Research question: Do the biological activity of the hydroalcoholic extracts from five Bursera species studied depend on their flavonoid content? Study site: Oaxaca, Mexico. Methods: The extracts of B. aptera Ramirez, B. fagaroides (Kunth) Engl., B. schlechtendalii Engl., B. galeottiana Engl., B. morelensis Ramirez were analysed by High Resolution Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to determine their flavonoid composition. The antiradical DPPH, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were determined. Results: Phlorizin and quercetin were conserved in both stems and leaves of the five species studied. The phloretin was present only in the leaves of B. aptera. The highest antibacterial activity was observed against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Salmonella typhimurium by the extracts of leaves of B. aptera (MIC 0.002 mg/mL) and the stems of B. fagaroides (MIC 0.015 mg/mL). The extract of stems of B. morelensis against Fusarium boothii presented the highest antifungal effect (lower than 50 mu g/mL). The anti-inflammatory activity of B. fagaroides was 51.24 % edema inhibition (1 mg/ear) compare to 78.76 % of indomethacin (0.358 mg/ear).

Other species have been less investigated, and their therapeutic potential is unknown. This is one of the few studies on Scutellaria brevibracteata subsp. subvelutina, and the first research of this species' in vitro cultures. The aim of this study was to establish an in vitro culture and analyse its phytochemical profile and biological activity. In the methanolic extracts from biomass cultured on six solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium variants supplemented with different combinations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) in the range 0.5-3 mg/L analysed by HPLC, the presence of specific flavonoids (baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, wogonoside, scutellarin, chrysin), phenylpropanoid glycosides (verbascoside, isoverbascoside), and phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, ferulic, m-coumaric acids) was confirmed. The dominant metabolites were wogonoside and verbascoside with the highest content of 346 and 457 mg/100 g DW, respectively. Thus, the extract with the highest content of bioactive metabolites was selected for further research and subjected to evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial potential. The extract exhibited good free radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.92 +/- 0.01 mg/mL) and moderate reducing power and chelating activity. The brine shrimp lethality bioassay proved its lack of biotoxicity. Antimicrobial activity was tested against sixteen strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

MethodsThese plants were collected in different areas in Tunisia. Their methanolic extracts were evaluated for their total phenolic content and for their antiradical (DPPH), antimicrobial (on 35 bacteria and one yeast), antiviral (hepatitis C virus, HCV) and cytotoxic activity (against WI38 and J774 cell lines). The most active species were subjected to a bioguided fractionation. Key findingsThe screening revealed promising activity for four plants, but two species have both antiradical and antimicrobial activity: Juncus maritimus and Limonium virgatum. The rhizomes extract of J. maritimus showed the highest activity against HCV, a selective antibacterial activity against Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and a moderate antiradical activity which is due to luteolin isolated in one step by centrifugal partition chromatography. The stems' and leaves' extracts of L. virgatum were rich in polyphenols responsible for the antiradical activity. Also, Limonium extracts showed an antibacterial activity with a broad spectrum.

Material and methods: The berberine content in different extracts of T. foliolosum roots collected from various altitudes was estimated using HPTLC. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined using Folin-Ciocalteau reagent and aluminum chloride method respectively. The sensitivity of microbes for the extracts was studied using disc diffusion and the MIC was estimated using broth dilution method. Antioxidant capacity of the plant was studied using beta-carotene bleaching assay, lipid peroxidation assay using goat liver, reducing power assay and DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Results: Berberine content varied inversely with altitude; while phenol and flavonoid content of TF increased at higher altitudes. All the TF extracts showed moderate to high activity against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extracts with high berberine content were most effective against C. albicans and S. aureus and also showed relatively significant anti-lipid peroxidation, beta-carotene bleaching and reducing power. TF extracts with higher phenol and flavonoid content showed better scavenging of DPPH free radicals. Berberine was used as a standard in all the antioxidant and antimicrobial experiments performed. Conclusion: Thalictrum from lower elevations can be explored as an alternate source of berberine and the plant has high antioxidant and antimicrobial properties owing to its berberine content.

In this study, the dichloromethane extract of stems of Waltheria indica L. was found to exhibit broad-spectrum antifungal activity toward eight phytopathogenic fungi, particularly against carbendazim-resistant Sclerotinia sclerotiorum with inhibition rate of 100% at 500 mu g/mL. Two quinoline alkaloids, antidesmone and waltherione C, were isolated and identified as fungicidal compounds by bioassay-guided isolation and spectroscopic analyses. Antidesmone displayed superior antifungal activities against eight phytopathogenic fungi to commercial botanical fungicides (osthole, carvacrol, and eugenol). Moreover, antidesmone was found to have significant negative cross-resistance with carbendazim to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum for the first time and exhibited much better antifungal activity (EC50 = 0.60 mu g/mL) against carbendazim-resistant strains than carbendazim-sensitive strain (EC50 = 9.61 mu g/mL) of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which was further supported by the molecular modelling result. In addition, the dichloromethane extract of the Waltheria indica stems could effectively control the development of eleven species of phytopathogenic fungi in vivo.

Annonaceae seems to be one of the least chemically as well as pharmacologically known families compared with its large size. Earlier studies on Annona species have showed that this family is a potent source of a wide variety of secondary metabolites belonging to several categories. The chemistry and anti-inflammatory effects of the seed oils of Annona species have been studied and published. Several antibacterial and anti-inflammatory kaurane-type diterpenes were isolated and identified, and biological evaluations were also carried out and published. The pesticidal activity of various extracts has been reported and their formulations have been tested against a wide spectrum of pests of national importance. Flowers of some Annonaceae are used in perfumery and many members of this family are used in folk medicine of some tropical countries to treat various types of cancers and tumors. In the present study we used various solvent extracts of Annona squamosa fruit pericarp to test for cytotoxic activity using in vitro cultures of Dalton's lymphoma cells as well as HeLa cells. Cytotoxicity was detected by the Trypan blue exclusion test and induction of apoptosis was evaluated by [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (MTS assay) and DNA ladder assay. The chloroform extract of Annona squamosa pericarp was found to be cytotoxic to the different cell lines tested. The inhibitory concentration required for 50% cytotoxicity (IC50) was also determined. The bioactivity-directed isolation yielded two kaurane-type diterpenes, (-)-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid and 16 alpha,17-dihydroxy-ent-kauran-19-oic acid.

10.1017/S1479262116000290,"Goswami, HK; Sen, K; Mukhopadhyay, R",2016,Pteridophytes: evolutionary boon as medicinal plants,"Selective use of crude plant extracts has been the oldest ritual in ancient Indian Medicinal System 'Ayurveda', as well as in Traditional Chinese Medicine system for thousands of years. This has been well documented that herbal medicines of Chinese, Indian, Korean and Native American people had included bryophytes, lichens, lycophytes and ferns. Since antiquity, most of the ferns and fern allies have given many health benefits to ancient civilizations who had used them for food, tea and drugs. Modern approaches have combined multidisciplinary technologies and have specific chemical compounds extracted and identified for producing very particulate medicines from plant parts. Plants, which yield appreciable quality and quantity of polysaccharides, steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids and antibiotics are suitable for dragging out drugs for many ailments/diseases, including cancer treatments. Modern explorations on the functional activities of pteridophytes for human health by discovering specific compounds and their usage in medicines have widened the scope of pteridophytes by shaping these plants as a great boon for pharmaceutical companies and related industries. Even 'fern weeds', which invade our freshwater bodies and reduce the freshwater wealth of a lake, e.g. Azolla, Salvinia, Marsilea, Ceratopteris, etc. can be utilized to produce life saving drugs because they are reservoirs of very many organic compounds that are useful as medicines. Some of the fern genera have a few unique secondary metabolites, which have not been discovered in higher plants. Polyphenols are useful phytochemicals, which provide health benefits such as antioxidants. From experiments on screening of total polyphenol contents of 37 ferns and fern allies, Polystichum lepidocaulon and Polystichum polyblepharum were reported to have more than 13% of total polyphenols from dried materials of both fronds and rhizomes. In addition, fronds of Davallia mariesii and rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortune, Dicranopteris pedata, Athyrium niponicum and Dryopteris nipponensis showed more than 10% of total polyphenols from dried materials. High bioactivities of traditional medicinal ferns have been studied internationally to underscore their roles in medicine. These attempts have confirmed various bioactivities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and anti-HIV, etc. The occurrence of antibiotic activity in the extracts of more than 200 species of pteridophytes has been shown to be of prime significance within the period of 1975-2015. The active substances in many cases were found to be antibacterial to penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dryopteris cochleata was active against both bacteria and fungi. Five other species of Dryopteris showed remarkable antibacterial activity. The ferns of 'Adiantum group' have been found to be particularly active against Gram-positive bacteria. The polypodiaceous ferns constitute a rich group of which Microsorum alternifolium, Leptochillus decurrens, Polypodium irioides, Pyrrosia mannii and Phymatodes ebenipes deserve special mention. Several thelypteroid, davallioid and athyrioid ferns, in addition to antibiotic activity have also been found to show most useful bioactivity for our life - the antioxidant activity. The latter superb biochemical quality of ferns alone makes most ferns of great advantage to human health. Lycophytes particularly Lycopodium clavatum and Equisetum hyemale and ferns (Dryopteris and Adiantums) have had constituted the backbone of Homeopathic medicines and now many more genera have been added to the network of modern medicinal approaches in the drug industry. These pteridophytes are indispensably integral parts of forests world over. A few of the aquatic ferns (Azolla, Salvinia) serve as excellent biofertilizers and bioremediation agents. Medicinal plants are under cultivation and cultured world over. Botanically, say a thousand years ago, these were wild and many of them were weeds. As pteridophytes have survived since Paleozoic, they have undergone series of disruptive adaptive changes of environment than any other vascular plants. These plants most likely, could withstand the tests of geological time on account of their being guarded with genetic capability of possessing many useful oils, phytochemicals (secondary metabolites) such as flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, phenols, triter-penoid compounds, varieties of amino acids and fatty acids, which in turn offer inherent tolerance and defense system. Additionally, from evolutionary point of view majority of ferns have constituted carpet flora and have worked as 'cradles' in natural forests so as to nurture small animals particularly reptiles and mammals. Ferns are denominators of prevalent rich biodiversity in almost every part of the earth. Comparison of evolutionary adaptations and natural innovations illuminate the genetic basis for the development of organisms. It is emphasized that there should be good field stations just in the peripheral region of reserved forests with large green houses to function as 'Fernariums/Mossariums/and/or Lichenariums' to conserve and maintain rare, endangered and medicinally superlative species found in those areas/forests. Gene networks (DNA stretches) that retain similar wiring diagrams (some or many similar DNA sequences) among related, distantly related or even totally diverse organisms point to the ways in which regulatory regions of the genome have evolved. Indisputably, comparative genomics can help us in deciphering evolvability of gene network and conservation modes during vast geological journey in evolution.

However, the preventive fungicides against this fungus have restricted use due to the deleterious effects on human health and the environment, prompting the need for sustainable alternatives. Here, we describe the antifungal activity of an aqueous extract of Hedera helix L. leaves (HAE) against D. corticola and the possible mechanism of action. Results/Methods: The chemical analysis revealed compounds like the saponin hederacoside C, quinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, rutin, and glycoside derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol, all of which have been previously reported to possess antimicrobial activity. Remarkable in vitro antifungal activity was observed, reducing radial mycelial growth by 70% after 3 days of inoculation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, bck1 and mkk1/mkk2, affected the cell wall integrity signaling pathway were more resistant to HAE than the wild-type strain, suggesting that the extract targets kinases of the signaling pathway, which triggers toxicity. The viability under osmotic stress with 0.75 M NaCl was lower in the presence of HAE, suggesting the deficiency of osmotic protection by the cell wall.

Conversely, gallotannins and anthocyanins were uniquely detected in P. zonale. P. graveolens stood out due to the various types of myricetin derivatives that were not detected in P. odoratissimum and P. zonale extracts. Evaluation of their biological activities revealed that P. zonale displayed superior antibacterial and antibiofilm activities in comparison to the other two species.

Extracts and Secondary Metabolite: Ursolic Acid,"Erica manipuliflora Salisb. and Erica arborea L. are common species in the seaside areas in Turkey. The aerial parts of Erica manipuliflora and Erica arborea, have been generally utilized as astringent, diuretic and cure of urinary infections in Turkey. Although we have encountered any antifungal activity studies of the plant in the literature, we learned that this plant was used by the people of Mugla to cure nail fungus. Therefore we started to study on Erica manipuliflora salisb. The aim of our work to obtain biologically active (antifungal) substances from the aboveground part of Erica manipuliflora salisb., identification of these compounds using 1D and 2D NMR and FABMS methods and evaluation of antifungal activity of the main metabolites of the extractive fractions n-BuOH (EBA-EBE) against Candida albicans in vitro. As a result of our study, one known oleanane-type aglycone was isolated as a major compound from the aerial part of Erica manipuliflora salisb. The structure elucidation of the compound was primarily obtained by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques and FABMS. The output of our studies supports that triterpene saponins with the oleanane-type skeleton might be chemotaxonomically important for the genus Erica.

In this investigation, four species were analyzed in order to determine the main secondary metabolites and antimicrobial activity of extracts obtained from aerial parts of Valeriana parviflora, V. rosaliana, V. triplinervis and V. phylicoides. Alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, sterols, triterpenoids and saponins were qualitatively observed in all methanolic extracts tested. The color intensity or a precipitate formation was used as analytical response to these tests. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram positive, Gram negative bacterial strains and yeast, using disc diffusion method. N-hexane extracts of V. triplinenns and V. rosaliana showed the highest efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting inhibition zones of 16 mm and 15 mm; MIC (Minimal Inhibition Concentration) values were observed at 116 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL, respectively. Dichloromethane and methanolic extracts of V. triplinervis and methanolic extract of V. rosaliana showed a rather moderate activity (MIC between 200 to 316 mg/ml) but a very weak antibacterial activity was observed in V. phylicoides and V. parviflora extracts (MIC > 420 mg/mL). None of the extracts assayed in this investigation showed any activity against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences on the different polarity extracts assayed with respect to antimicrobial activity against S. aureus (P > 0.10), however it was observed significant differences between the Valeriana species analyzed (P < 0.10) in relation to the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).",REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,Valeriana; antimicrobial activity; phytochemical; Venezuela,VALERIANA-WALLICHII; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; ESSENTIAL OILS; IN-VITRO; EPIDEMIOLOGY; JATAMANSI; RHIZOMES; EXTRACT,"[Rondon, Maria; Rojas, Janne; Morales, Antonio] Univ Los Andes, Fac Pharm & Bioanal, Organ Biomol Res Grp, Merida, Venezuela; [Velasco, Judith] Univ Los Andes, Microbiol & Parasitol Dept, Fac Pharm & Bioanal, Merida, Venezuela; [Gamez, Luis] Univ Los Andes, Fac Forestry & Environm Sci, Merida, Venezuela; [Leon, Gudberto; Entralgo, Efrain] Univ Los Andes, Stat Sch, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Merida, Venezuela",Candida krusei,"Valeriana phylicoides, Valeriana rosaliana, Valeriana triplinervis, Valeriana parviflora",,"Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae","tannins, alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, saponins","tannins, alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, saponins",Staphylococcus aureus,positive,Candida albicans,"Valeriana phylicoides, Valeriana rosaliana, Valeriana triplinervis, Valeriana parviflora","Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Caprifoliaceae","Valeriana, Valeriana, Valeriana, Valeriana",Venezuela

In this study, an ethanolic extract produced from sugarcane straw was screened for its phenolic compounds content, and the potential use of this extract in the development of a food ingredient was further evaluated. Fifty different secondary metabolites belonging to the hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ultrahigh-resolution-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-UHR-QqTOF-MS). The predominant phenolic compounds found were 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, chlorogenic acid, and 5-O-feruloylquinic acid. The obtained extracts showed strong potential as food preservatives by exhibiting (a) antioxidant activity using both 2.2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods; and (b) antimicrobial capacity, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 50 mg/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 74% inhibition for Bacillus cereus, and 44% for Salmonella enterica; and (c) the capacity to inhibit a food browning enzyme, tyrosinase (28-73% for 1-8 mg/ mL). Moreover, the extracts showed antidiabetic potential by inhibiting the enzymes alpha-glucosidase (15-38% for 1.25-5.00 mg/mL) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) (62-114% for 0.31-5.00 mg/mL). The extract (0.625 mg/mL) also exhibited the capacity to reduce proinflammatory mediators (i.e., interleukins 6 and 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) when Caco-2 cells were stimulated with interleukin 1 beta. Thus, sugarcane straw extract, which is rich in phenolic compounds, showed high potential to be used in the development of food-preservative ingredients owing to its antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, and to be explored as a food supplement in diabetes prevention and as coadjuvant to reduce intestinal inflammation by reducing proinflammatory mediators.",FOODS,MDPI,Saccharum officinarum L; straw; phenolic compounds; antidiabetic; antityrosinase; anti-inflammatory,ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS; OFFICINARUM L.

To diminish infectious disease-causing pathogens, new antibiotics are required while the drying pipeline of potent antibiotics is adding to the severity. Plant secondary metabolites or phytochemicals including alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, and terpenes have successfully demonstrated their inhibitory potential against the drug-resistant pathogens. In quest of potential phytochemicals, we selected tea (Camellia sinensis) and agarwood (Aquilaria malaccensis) leaves for antimicrobial activity. Fresh tea leaves were collected in three varieties, namely, BT-6, BT-7, and BT-8, including green tea (nonfermented tea), black tea (fully fermented tea), and agarwood leaves collected from Sylhet region of Bangladesh. This study is aimed at analyzing the phytochemical constituency and antimicrobial activity of tea and agarwood leaf extracts and analyzing if there is a combined effect or synergistic activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of tea and agarwood leaf extracts was analyzed against MDR pathogenic bacteria and fungus. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical constituency profiling of these six leaf extracts was evaluated, and preliminary screening exhibited that most of the leaves contained diverse groups of metabolites (alkaloids, tannin, flavonoids, glycosides, saponins, etc.). The highest amounts of TPC (total phenolic content) (110.16 +/- 0.48 mu g/mg) were found in BT-7 in ethanol extracts, and BT-8 in methanol extracts possessed the highest (128.1 +/- 0.43 mu g/mg) TFC (total flavonoid content). Notably, green tea showed remarkable results in TPC and TFC. In antioxidant scavenging activity, BT-7 and green tea showed significant IC50 values which were 13.23 and 20.75mg/mL, respectively. In antimicrobial assays, both 50 mu L of each tea and agarwood leaf extract antimicrobial activities were examined against 50 mu L of each bacterial and fungal culture. In synergistic activity, 50 mu L of each type of leaf extracts was poured over the commercial antibiotics to evaluate their synergism, additive, or antagonism activity against the multidrug-resistant pathogens. In the antimicrobial activity test, green tea showed a maximum diameter (22.0 +/- 1.1mm) zone of inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae whereas BT-8 showed 22.0 +/- 2.5mm against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Indeed, fresh tea BT-6 and BT-7 both showed remarkable zone of inhibition against the selected microbes including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Besides, leaf extract also showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungus Mucor circinelloides. Aiming to increase antibiotic resistance efficacy, synergistic activities were evaluated among leaf extracts and antibiotics against the selected pathogens where synergism, antagonism, and additive results were noted. Combination of BT-8 extracts with antibiotics (ceftiofur) showed the highest synergism nearly 36mm of the zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli. Additionally, green tea with gentamicin and erythromycin also showed remarkable synergism 35 and 33mm against Mucor circinelloides and E. coli, respectively.

Several parts of B. aegyptiaca have been suggested to have medicinal uses. So far the effect of ecological origin on the nutritional values and biological activities of B. aegyptiaca genotypes is rarely investigated. Further, metabolic profiling and assessment of the functional food value of B. aegyptiaca leaves are far from complete. In this study, biological activities and profiling of primary and secondary metabolites were investigated in the leaves of five B. aegyptiaca provenances collected from Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Interestingly, all provenances showed notable antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiprotozoal, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed significant variability in the concentrations of individual sugars, organic acids, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, phenolics, and minerals among the provenances and these variations were provenance dependent. Medina provenance showed the heights diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and antifungal activities and was the most powerful against embryonic kidney adenocarcinoma and urinary bladder carcinoma cells. The highest inhibition against Escherichia coli and colon carcinoma cells was observed by Sudan and Cairo provenances. El-Kharga and Yemen provenances showed the greatest activity against Trypanosoma cruzi and hepatocellular and urinary bladder carcinoma. Therefore, leaves of B. aegyptiaca possess good nutritive and biological capacities and might have potential applications in the food and medical industries. However, the strength of such activities is significantly affected by the provenance. Practical applications According to the national Research Council (NRC) of United States, Balanites aegyptiaca L. is recognized among the 24 priority lost crops of Africa. B. aegyptiaca leaves contain considerable amounts of primary metabolites (e.g., sugars, EAAs, USFAs) and secondary (e.g., phenolic acids and flavonoids) metabolites, vitamins, and macro and microelements. The obvious existence of these nutritionally and medicinally related compounds supports the functional food value of B. aegyptiaca leaves. Moreover, the present results revealed that B. aegyptiaca is not only a foliage dietary plant, but also could be considered as a valuable source for neutraceuticals, which support its pharmacological value. So far, this is the first report to explore, in detail, the functional food value of B. aegyptiaca leaves by presenting a clear image about its metabolic profiling and biological activities, and how the provenance factor could affect these values.",JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY,WILEY,anticancer; antidiabetic; antimicrobial; antioxidant; Balanites aegyptiaca; bioactive metabolites,PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L.; FRUITS; ENHANCE; ACID,"[Khamis, Galal] Cairo Univ, Natl Inst Laser Enhanced Sci, Dept Laser Applicat Metrol Photochem & Agr LAMPA, Giza, Egypt; [Saleh, Ahmed M.] Cairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Giza 12613, Egypt; [Saleh, Ahmed M.; Habeeb, Talaat H.] Taibah Univ, Fac Sci Yanbu, Biol Dept, Yanbu El Bahr, Saudi Arabia; [Hozzein, Wael N.; Wadaan, Mohammed A.

Therefore, the search for competent alternatives is a constant pursuit. Quinolizidine alkaloids (QA) are naturally occurring compounds with diverse biological activities. The structural diversity of quinolizidines is mainly contributed by species of the family Fabaceae, particularly the genus Lupinus. This quinolizidine-based chemo diversity can be explored to find antifungals and even mixtures to address concomitant effects on F. oxysporum. Thus, the antifungal activity of quinolizidine-rich extracts (QREs) from the leaves of eight greenhouse-propagated Lupinus species was evaluated to outline promising QA mixtures against F. oxysporum. Thirteen main compounds were identified and quantified using an external standard. Quantitative analysis revealed different contents per quinolizidine depending on the Lupinus plant, ranging from 0.003 to 32.8 mg/g fresh leaves.

Leaves for Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, and Cytotoxic Potential","Exploring new antimicrobial and cytotoxic drugs has been one of the most active areas of research. Rhamnus purpurea (Edgew.) buckthorn (Rhamnaceae) is a wild shrub traditionally used in Pakistan for the treatment of various ailments including cancer and infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to find novel antimicrobial and cytotoxic agents of plant origin. The crude methanol extract and full range of fractions of R. purpurea leaves were screened for the said activities using in vitro antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic models following standard protocols. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method, while the antioxidant activity was assessed with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The cytotoxic effect was investigated against the human cancer cell lines i.e. Caco-2 (gut), A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), and MDA-MB-231 (breast) by MTS assay. In addition, toxicity studies were conducted on renal and alveolar primary epithelial cells (HRPTEpiC and HPAEpiC, respectively). Phytochemical investigation showed the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, saponins, tannins, glycosides, phenols, carbohydrates, proteins, and flavonoids. The n-hexane and chloroform fractions showed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.60 and 0.68 mg/mL, respectively), Salmonella typhi (MIC 0.48 and 0.45 mg/mL, respectively), and Bacillus subtilis (MIC 0.54 and 0.76 mg/mL, respectively). Among fungal strains, crude methanol and chloroform fractions exhibited significant activity against Fusarium solani (MIC 0.53 and 0.44 mg/mL, respectively) and Aspergillus niger (MIC 0.47 and 0.42 mg/mL, respectively). The crude methanol, n-hexane and chloroform fractions revealed the highest antioxidant activity at 1000 mu g/mL, compared to that of ascorbic acid. The n-hexane fraction showed a significant cytotoxic effect against Caco-2, A549, and HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 5.65 +/- 0.88, 5.50 +/- 0.90, and 4.95 +/- 1.0 mu g/mL, respectively. Similarly, the chloroform fraction depicted significant activity against Caco-2, A549, and HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 4.55 +/- 1.25, 4.65 +/- 1.55, and 2.85 +/- 0.98 mu g/mL, respectively. The crude methanol extract and almost all fractions exhibited the highest selectivity index (>2.0) for Caco-2, A549, and HepG2 cancer cell lines, providing safety data for this study.

The use of these Folklore remedial herbs for therapeutic applications is contributing to maintenance of human health. The ancient literature, i.e., Ayurveda and Unani, also describes the global usage of herbal medicine for treatment, and its formulation's concoction for prevention of various diseases. Ehretia laevis is a conventional therapeutic herb from ancient times, frequently designated as Khandu Chakka by local people in Maharashtra. E. laevis leaves are used in the treatment of skin infections, fungal infections, mouth blisters, eczema, cuts and wounds, diabetes, asthma, fever and joint pain etc. The leaf of this plant contains abundant therapeutically beneficial secondary metabolites besides primary metabolites. This paper describes antimicrobial sensitivity of E. laevis leaf (fresh and dried) acetone and ethyl alcohol (95%) soxhlet extract and dried leaf dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) extract (prepared after from evaporation of acetone in dried leaf acetone extract) against isolated oral microbial flora i.e., Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. Amoxicillin in dimethyl sulphoxide was also tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. The result revealed that E. laevis fresh leaf ethyl alcohol and acetone extract and dried leaf acetone and DMSO extract was efficacious against isolated oral microbial flora. The extracts showed positive results for flavonoids and tannins. The results showed the antibacterial and antifungal potential of this folklore plant, particularly against S. aureus and Candida spp., which are microorganisms that are becoming resistant against most therapeutic drugs.

Baillon, an endemic traditional medicinal plant of Mauritius","Psiloxylon mauritianum (Bouton ex Hook.f.) Baillon (PM) is a traditional medicinal plant used for the treatment and management of dysentery and common infectious diseases in Mauritius. Locally, the plant is orally administered in the form of a broth made with the young leaves for its curative properties. Though the traditional use of this plant had been documented in early ethnomedicinal surveys, it had however never been studied. This study thus endeavors at validating the traditional use of PM and purifying the active bioactive secondary metabolites responsible for any observed biological activity. The crude extract was assessed in vitro for growth inhibiting activity against several microbial strains using both the broth microdilution assay and bioautography. Additionally, the antioxidant activity was assessed using standard assays and the most active extract was submitted to bioguided fractionation for further evaluation. PM was found to be both strongly antibacterial and antioxidant. The crude acetone extract as well as its subsequent preliminary tannin-less fractions was found to be markedly anti-staphylococcal. Lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of 51 mu g/ml and 19 mu g/ml were recorded for the crude extract and the most polar preliminary tannin-less (20% methanol in dichloromethane) fraction of PM, respectively. On the other hand, the plant was found to be only weakly antifungal, inhibiting the growth of Candida albicans at 325 mg/ml. Consequently, PM extract was further fractionated and the fractions were tested on Staphylococcus aureus. Bioassay guided fractionation led to the isolation and identification of (2 alpha, 3 beta)dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid and (2 alpha, 3 beta) 23-trihydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, commonly known as, corosolic and asiatic acid respectively for the first time from this endemic species of Mauritius. The present study thus clearly indicates that PM possessed substantial antimicrobial, in particular anti-staphylococcal activity which corroborates with its use in the traditional Mauritian pharmacopoeia as a plant having potential anti-infective properties. The results so far obtained further substantiate, not only, the importance of screening medicinal plants as reliable sources of lead molecules, but also provide additional credence to the traditional uses of such plant.

Both roots and aerial parts of Scorzonera species are used. S. pygmaea is endemic to Turkey. in a previous study, nine phenolic compounds were reported from the roots of the plant alongside certain biological activities. The current study was designed to investigate the aerial parts of the plant in the same manner and compare the potentials of the two parts. Methods: Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods were used to isolate and identify the phenolics. Total phenolic contents were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method. FRAP assay, anti-LPO, scavenging DPPH, ABTS and superoxide radicals were employed to evaluate the antioxidant activity. COX inhibition test and micro broth dilution technique were used for anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities, respectively. Results: Seven phenolic compounds; thunberginol C (1), protocatechuic acid (2), chlorogenic acid methyl ester (3), cudrabibenzyl A (4), scorzocreticin (5), scorzocreticoside I (6) and II (7) were purified. All the compounds are new for the aerial parts of the plant and 2 is new for the genus. The aerial parts showed a high antioxidant capacity which correlated with its phenolic content. COX inhibitory activity was found to be lower compared to Indomethacin. Weak antimicrobial activity was determined against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Conclusion: Aerial parts possess significant/infrequent phenolics and the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction of the ethanol extract is the most promising fraction for isolating these compounds. Phenolic compositions of aerial parts and roots are very similar.

MAXIM: EVALUATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL POTENTIAL (ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTIOXIDANT AND TOXICITY) AND PHENOLIC PROFILES","Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim) is Rosaceae family perennial herb. Traditional uses of F. ulmaria include inflammatory problems like rheumatism, arthrosis, and arthritis), gastrointestinal disorders, liver malfunction, and gout. The pharmaceutical industry has been very interested in this plant because of its health benefits. The presence of phenolic secondary metabolites is thought to be the primary cause of meadowsweet's biological activity and therapeutic efficacy. This study was intended to compare and evaluate the biological activities (antibacterial, antioxidant, antitumor and toxicity) and phenolic profiles (total phenol-flavonoid content and individual phenolic constituents) of F. ulmaria aerial parts obtained from two different sources (naturally- and in vitro-grown). Antibacterial activity was evaluated using 17 different bacteria (10 human and 7 fish pathogens) with disc diffusion method. Methanolic extracts of in vitro-grown parts showed higher antibacterial effect than naturally-grown parts with all tested bacterial pathogens (human and fish). On the other hand, other extracts (aqueous, ethanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate) demonstrated higher antibacterial potential with field-grown parts. The highest sensitivity was observed with Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and Enterobacter cloacae to aqueous extract of field-grown plants. The potent antibacterial activity of F. ulmaria extracts rendered the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato disc tumor assay inapplicable. Toxicity assay (brine shrimp) showed that aqueous extract of both sources had the lowest toxicity. Methanolic extract of both parts had a strong antioxidant potential (DPPH radical scavenging activty) having IC50 values as 205.65 mu g/mL and 206.74 mu g/mL, respectively, and similar level of overall total phenol-flavonoid contents. Individual phenolic analysis with HPLC-DAD showed that the most prevalent phenol was rutin in both sources. While the quantities of chlorogenic acid in both aerial parts were similar, the parts that were grown naturally had higher levels of salicylic acid and rutin. These findings demonstrated the effective antibacterial and antioxidant properties, high phenolic content, and low toxicity of both F. ulmaria sources, indicating that they can be utilized in nutraceutical industry due to their high health promoting potential.",PROSPECTS IN PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,MEDICAL UNIV WARSAW,Antibacterial; antioxidant; brine shrimp; Filipendula ulmaria; meadowsweet,MEADOWSWEET FILIPENDULA-ULMARIA; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; PLANT-EXTRACTS; L.; CONSTITUENTS; PRODUCTS; ASSAY,"[Yildirim, Arzu Birinci] Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Field Crops, TR-14030 Bolu, Turkey; [Cimen, Ayca; Baba, Yavuz; Turker, Arzu Ucar] Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Biol, TR-14030 Bolu, Turkey",##ENDULA ULMARIA,Filipendula ulmaria,,Rosaceae,"phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics","phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics","Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae","positive, negative",,Filipendula ulmaria,Rosaceae,Filipendula,Turkey

Recently, NPs have been employed as novel and effective elicitors to increase the yields of chemical compounds in plants. In the present study, zinc acetate and cetyltriammonium bromide (CTAB) were used as reactants to effectively synthesize ZnO-NPs using a straightforward hydrothermal process. Zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO-NPs) were evaluated using an X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Different Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/l) were added to the liquid callus medium of Gardenia jasminoides Variegata, and the calli cultures were harvested after 8 days. The amounts of rosmarinic and cinnamic acids were quantified using HPLC. Antioxidant activities were examined by 2,2 '- azino- bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical cation (ABTS center dot+) and 2,2-Diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The total content of phenolics and flavonoids has been assessed. It was reported that adding 25 mg/l ZnO nanorods represents the highest fresh weight (6.5 +/- 0.3 g) compared to the control (5.14 +/- 0.005 g). For accumulation of rosmarinic acid in callus culture of G. jasminoides Variegata using ZnO nanorods, 10 mg/l ZnO nanorods elevated the rosmarinic acid content fivefold compared with the control (250, 50 mu g/GFW, respectively), in the same respect 10 mg/l ZnO nanorods recorded the highest antioxidant activity among the other concentrations with both methods ABTS as well as DPPH. The highest cinnamic acid (83 mu g/GFW), considered twice its content in the control (39 mu g/GFW), was recorded by adding 50 mg/l ZnO nanorods. The antimicrobial activity of the extract of each treatment was also examined against five microbial organisms. The results confirmed a potent activity against candida albicans for treatment No. 3, 5, and 6 extracts.

Despite their potential, much remains untapped, whether in standardized extracts or isolated pure compounds. This unexplored terrain has paved the way for significant discoveries in pharmaceuticals. Notably, research has delved into the medicinal properties of Mallotus philippensis, a prominent plant in South Asia. Employing meticulous extraction techniques such as maceration, the fruit of this plant underwent initial antimicrobial screening, revealing encouraging results. Subsequent fractionation of the plant's extracts via liquid-liquid extractions, utilizing dichloromethane and absolute ethanol, facilitated further analysis. Evaluating these fractions for antibacterial activity demonstrated efficacy against various pathogenic microorganisms, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, notably by the ethanolic and dichloromethane extracts. Furthermore, a comprehensive phytochemical analysis unveiled the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, phenols, and tannins. An assessment of the extracts' antioxidant potential via the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay showcased significant activity, with a radical scavenging rate of 97%. This underscores the significance of utilizing fruit remnants, which are often rich in valuable chemical constituents yet commonly discarded, thereby adding value to both the species and the environment. Further investigation focused on the composition of Mallotus philippensis fruit, encompassing volatile and non-volatile metabolites through HPLC-MS analysis. Additionally, this study introduced the application of ionic liquid-loaded polysulfone microcapsules to enrich target constituents from crude extracts.

Preliminary phytochemical screening has shown the presence of various phytochemicals such as carbohydrates, protein, amino acids, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, glycosides, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, steroids, and phenolic compounds. The percentage variation of some components fluctuated like moisture (6.85-10.34%), ash (5.38-7.83%), acid insoluble ash (0.28-0.71%), water-soluble ash (0.78-0.96%), hexane extractives (1.23-1.91%), alcohol extractives (10.39-12.23%), water extractives (25.34-30.35%), loss on drying (1.16-1.47%) and crude fiber (15.04-18.26%) for leaves, stems, and fruits respectively. The level of free fatty acid was different as follows: leaves (2.37%), stems (2.16%), and fruits (2.94%); a high value of peroxide was observed in stems, followed by leaves and fruits. The iodine and saponification values in leaves, stems, and fruits were found in the range of 105-116 g I2/100 g, and 165-175 mg KOH/g.

The cytotoxicity was tested on rat intestinal epithelial cells using the MTT assay. The results pointed out important constituents such as secoiridoid glycoside (amarogentin), phenolic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, trans-p-coumaric acid, salicylic acid), and flavonoids (apigenin, chrysin, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, quercetin, rutoside, and naringenin) and promising antioxidant properties. The in vitro antimicrobial effect was noticed towards several pathogens (Bacillus cereus > Staphylococcus aureus > Enterococcus faecalis > Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis > Escherichia coli), with a pronounced bactericidal activity. Rat intestinal epithelial cell viability was not affected by the selected concentrations of these two extracts.

The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical profile of Brazilian propolis, as well as their in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was applied for chemical profiling of propolis extracts. Total phenolic compounds were quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu and antioxidant properties were assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus. Correlation and multivariate statistical analysis were used to identify potential bioactive compounds in the extracts. Twenty-nine metabolites were identified along with 34 other metabolites that were classified into the following classes: triterpenoids (12), acetyltriterpenoids (3), sesquiterpenes (6), steroids (4), and hydrocarbons (9). The antioxidant capacity (IC50) ranged from 21.50 to 78.77 mu g/mL, whereas the content of total phenolic compounds ranged from 31.88 to 204.30 mg GAE/g of dry weight Total phenolic compounds and methyl retinoate showed a positive correlation with the antioxidant capacity, whereas tetradecanal, gamma-palinitolactone and ethyl hydrocinnamate showed a negative correlation. Different sets of metabolites are shown to correlate with the antibacterial activity of the extracts, which is largely dependent on the type of microorganism. This innovative approach allowed us to identify likely bioactive compounds in the extracts, although the mechanism(s) underlying antibacterial activity encompass a complex trait, which might involve synergistic effects.

Berg) McVaugh (Myrtaceae), a Traditional Plant Growing in Ecuador","Myrcianthes hallii (o. Berg) McVaugh (Myrtaceae) is a plant native to Ecuador, traditionally used for its antiseptic properties. The composition of the hydro-methanolic extract of this plant was determined by submitting it to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated to heated-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and UV detection. The presence of antimicrobial components prompted us to test the extract against methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant and susceptible Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. The chromatographic analysis led to the identification of 38 compounds, including polyphenols and organic acids, and represents the first chemical characterization of this plant. The extract showed modest antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, with the exception of E. coli which was found to be less sensitive. Whilst methicillin-resistant strains usually display resistance to several drugs, no relevant differences were observed between methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains. Considering its long-standing use in folk medicine, which suggests the relative safety of the plant, and the presence of many known antibacterial polyphenolic compounds responsible for its antibacterial activity, the results show that M. hallii extract could be used as a potential new antiseptic agent. Moreover, new anti-infective biomaterials and nanomaterials could be designed through the incorporation of M. hallii polyphenols.

OBJECTIVE: This work assessed the influence of different drying methods: freeze drying (FD), convective drying (CD), vacuum drying (VD), sun drying (SD), and infrared drying (IRD) on the antimicrobial activity of murta berries against four microbial species. METHODS: Murta berries were subjected to five drying methods. Measurement of bioactive compounds that include: phenolic compounds by HPLC, total flavonoid content by a spectrophotometric method; and anthocyanins by HPLC-MS. Determination of antioxidant capacity by DPPH and ORAC methods and antimicrobial activity by means of agar well diffusion assay. RESULTS: Murta extracts obtained by FD and CD showed the highest antimicrobial activity, with Staphylococcus aureus the most susceptible species. Drying induced a significant loss of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity although minimal losses were observed in FD, CD and VD extracts. In these extracts, the abundance of bioactive compounds correlated with the antimicrobial activity.

However, during the industrial processing of murta fruits, the biomass containing the seeds is discarded as an industrial byproduct that does not find significant uses yet. This work is a first approach to valorize murta biomass through the identification and quantification of principal chemical constituents and exploring their antibacterial properties. The proximal analysis revealed that murta seeds exhibited significant content of raw fiber (64%), crude fat (14%), crude protein (12%), and low levels of ashes (1.5%) and minerals (0.04-0.23%). Dietary fiber was mainly composed of lignin, cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (89.0%), monounsaturated fatty acids (7.7%), and saturated fatty acids (3.3%) were the main constituents of seed oils. The arginine, asparagine, glutamic acid, and glycine were the primary protein constituent amino acids. Tannin fractions, total polyphenolic content, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity as antioxidant activity were measured.

(Caryocaraceae) is a plant found in the region of Araripe (Ceara State, Brazil) and is widely used in folk medicine. The present work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and synergistic-antibiotic activity of a hydroethanol leaf extract (LECC) and a methanol fraction (LECC-MF) of C. coriaceum. Methodology: Qualitative phytochemical analysis of both extracts was performed and the quantification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds was performed by HPLC-DAD. The antimicrobial activity of a hydroethanol leaf extract of C. coriaceum (LECC) and a methanol fraction (LECC-MF) were analyzed by the microdilution test using standard and clinical multiresistant bacterial and fungal strains (Staphylococus aureus ATCC25923, Escherichia coli ATCC10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC15442, Klebsiella pneumonae ATCC4362, E. coli 27, S. aureus 358, Candida albicans ICB12 and Candida krusei ATCC6258). The synergism assay was performed with aminoglycosides (as amikacin, Kanamycin, gentamicin and neomycin) and antifungal drugs (as metronidazole, amphotericin B, nystatin, and benzoylmetronidazole). Results: The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of pyrogallic and hydrolisable tannins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and other phytocompounds. HPLC analysis showed a variety of compounds in both of the extracts, including gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutine and quercetine. Both the hydroethanol extract and methanol fraction showed no clinically relevant antimicrobial effect against the tested microorganisms. However, a synergistic activity was demonstrated by both natural products against E. coli 27 and S. aureus 358. Conclusion: These findings suggest that LECC and LECC-MF could be used as an important source of compounds with the potential to reduce the bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides.

Fomites are reservoirs of drug-resistant pathogens found in the unhygienic clinical environment, which can infect patients and leading to high nosocomial infection rates and use of antimicrobial drugs. The use of and search for drugs and dietary supplements derived from plants have accelerated various therapeutic applications and obtaining new antimicrobial agents from natural resources is necessary to develop alternative drugs for safe and cost-effective health care. Hence, the objective of this research was to perform a phytochemical analysis on Chromolaena odorata and to study the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of its leaves. In this regard, phytochemicals obtained from C. odorata was investigated for their radical scavenging activity using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of active ingredients such as glycosides, steroids, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and tannins were categorized either as primary metabolites, such as chlorophyll, proteins, and amino acids, or as secondary metabolites, which include terpenoids and alkaloids. The ethanolic leaf extract showed a higher antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties than the aqueous extract exhibited. C. odorata leaf extracts of both ethanoloic and aqueous were subjected to an antibacterial study using the agar diffusion method. Our antibacterial results showed that the ethanolic extract could inhibit to a certain extent the growth of various human pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli.

Haw. belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and the southern United States. O. dillenii are now used as medicinal plants in various countries. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of ethanolic extracts obtained from seeds, juice, and peel of O. dillenii fruits collected from Morocco, and we evaluated their antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic activities. Phytochemical screening revealed high quantities of polyphenols (193.73 +/- 81.44 to 341.12 +/- 78.90 gallic acid eq [g/100 g dry weight]) in the extracts. The major phenolic compounds determined by HPLC were gallic acid, vanillic acid, and syringic acid. Regarding flavonoids, quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside and kaempferol were the predominant molecules. Juice extracts showed weak to moderate antibacterial activity against the bacteria species Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella braenderup. All tested extracts displayed a significant inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase activities in vitro, with the peel extracts showing the greatest inhibitory effects. Together, these findings suggest that O. dillenii fruits are a promising source for the isolation of novel compounds with antibacterial or antidiabetic activities.

The targeted chemical characterization of the extracts was achieved using the Ultra-High-Performance-Liquid-Chromatography-Linear-TrapMass-Spectrometry OrbiTrap instrumental technique, while Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the structural properties of the examined leaf extracts. According to the results, the species P. officinalis, Bozurna locality as the origin of the plant material, and microwave-assisted extraction produced the maximum polyphenol yield, (491.9 +/- 2.7 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/mL). The ethanolic extracts exhibited moderate antioxidant activity as evaluated by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and phosphomolybdenum tests. With MIC values of 0.125 mg/mL, the leaf extracts produced by ultrasound-assisted extraction and maceration (Deliblato sands and Bogovo gumno) had the best antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella Typhimurium. Ultrasound-assisted extraction has proven to produce the most effective antimicrobial agents. Inhibitory potential towards glucosidase, amylase, cholinesterases, and tyrosinase was evaluated in enzyme inhibition assays and molecular docking simulations. Results show that leaves of P. tenuifolia L. obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction had the highest acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Namely, the complexity of the polyphenol structures, the extraction method, the used locality, and the different mechanisms of the reactions between bioactives from leaf extracts and other components (free radicals, microorganisms, and enzymes) are the main factors that influence the results of the antioxidant tests, as well as the antibacterial and enzyme-inhibitory activities of the extracts. Hydroxymethyl-phenyl pentosyl-hexoside and acetyl-hydroxyphenyl-hexoside were the first time identified in the leaf extract of the Paeonia species.

Fruit peels can be exploited to reduce agro-waste as natural bioactive compound owning to the antimicrobial properties. The present work envisaged to explore the phytochemical compounds in aqueous and ethanol extracts of three fruit peels from pomegranate (Punica granatum), banana (Musa acuminata) and orange (Citrus reticulata). Additionally, it was aimed to ascertain the antibacterial activities of fruit peel extracts against six human bacterial pathogens; Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Assessment of phytochemical proper-ties of pomegranate, banana, and orange peels revealed that these peels were rich in many bioactive compounds especially alkaloid, flavonoid, phlobatannins, saponins, terpenoids, glycosides, anthocyanosides, steroids, phenols, proteins, and carbohydrates. The antibiogram analysis was performed using four different antibiotics including cepharadin, ceftriaxone, pipemidic acid, and ofloxacin. Antimicrobial profiling indicated that the studied microorganisms were resistant to cepharadin and ceftriaxone, but susceptible to pipemidic acid and ofloxacin. S. aureus was found to be resistant against all applied antibiotics. On the other hand, ethanol extracts of pomegranate peels showed maximum inhibitory activities (29.66 +/- 1.63 mm) against M. luteus, banana peels (27.00 +/- 0.33 mm) against M. luteus, and orange peels (29.00 +/- 0.57 mm) against K. pneumonia.

Further, the physicochemical properties and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the PRF were evaluated against Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) infection in mice. The results showed that the PRF encapsulated in modified starch, maltodextrin, and whey protein concentrate as wall material possessed a capsulation efficiency of 83.7% with a particle size of 314.6 nm. The phytochemical analysis of developed phytobiotic confirmed the presence of phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, vanillic acid, pyrogallol, cinnamic acid, ellagic acid, naringin, and chrysin. The developed phytobiotic could potentially improve the growth parameters, liver enzymes, and lipid peroxidation, enhance the ileum's morphometric parameters, and inhibit the ileal population of C. jejuni in the mice challenged by C. jejuni infection. Consequently, the phytobiotic developed based on F. gummosa leaf phenolic compounds could be considered a promising natural alternative to antibiotics.

Fritch Provides Optimized Conditions for the Biological and Chemical Characteristics of the Herbal Extracts,"Spiked centaury (Centaurium spicatum) is a well-known medicinal plant from the Mediterranean region with various bioactivities, but there are no studies addressing the use of different solvent systems to improve its pharmacological potential. Nine extraction procedures were adapted to study the effects of solvent composition on the content of bioactive compounds in C. spicatum extracts and on corresponding bioactivities. Targeted metabolomics was performed to obtain information on the chemical composition of extracts. Ethanol-water-based extraction procedures were the most efficient in isolating polyphenols, while less polar butanol extract contained the highest amount of iridoids. Antioxidant potential analysis revealed stronger activity in extracts with higher polyphenol content. Bacillus cereus and Staphylococus aureus were designated as the most sensitive bacterial strains to the activity of extracts, while among the micromycetes tested, Penicillium funiculosum was the most susceptible strain. Butanol extract showed antivirulence potential on Candida albicans morphological transition from yeast to hyphal form, and selected extracts were effective against biofilm formation in two Candida species. All the extracts tested in this study showed no cytotoxic activity to immortalize human skin keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), whereas extracts obtained by ethanol-water extraction stand out for their potent wound healing effects. Moreover, the influence of the extraction solvent system on various bioactivities of C. spicatum is reported herein for the first time.

The current study focused on the Asplenium dalhousieae Hook for detailed morphological, pharmacognostic, and phytochemical evaluation. Here we used the fresh and powdered fronds of Asplenium dalhousieae for its macroscopic and microscopic characterization. Phytochemical investigations were carried out by using ethanolic, methanolic, and distilled water extracts. Antimicrobial, phytotoxic, and antioxidant properties were assessed using crude methanolic extracts. The macroscopic characteristic of the plant revealed a dark green color, smooth powdered medicine texture, and an aromatic odor. Different types of cells and their micrometry were detected in microscopic features, confirming that the Asplenium dalhousieae has a wide range of cells such as subsidiary cells, scalariform arteries, desmocytic stomata, and polygonal epidermal cells. Phytochemical analysis showed the existence of multiple phytochemical compounds such as flavonoids, phenols, glycosides, alkaloids, coumarin, anthraquinones, quinones, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids, and saponins. Subsequently, plant antimicrobial response against various bacterial and fungal strains ( Streptococcus mitis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhi and Carvularia, Fusarium, Alternaria, Rhizopus, Aspergillus) determined a significant response when compared with standard drug ciprofloxacin and miconazole respectively. The phytotoxic response against the test plant Lemna minor indicated 75% growth of inhibition revealing potent herbicidal aptitude. Further, antioxidant potential revealed 34% inhibition by DPPH and 55.7% inhibition by phosomolybdate complex assay.

The different organs of Pentanema confertiflorum (hereafter referred as P. confertiflorum) as have been used to ameliorate different diseases in Ethiopia. Thus, this study focused on the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis, antioxidant, and antibacterial screening of P. confertiflorum rootbark solvent fractions. Methods: The rootbark of P. confertiflorum was successively soaked with petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol. The total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC), and alkaloid contents (TAC) of the different crude extracts were determined through Folin-Ciocalteu Reagent (FCR), aluminum chloride colorimetric, and bromocresol green (BCG) assays, respectively. In addition, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were employed to determine the antioxidant activity of crude extracts. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts was assessed against different bacteria strains via the disc diffusion method. Results: The qualitative phytochemical investigation study resonated with the abundance of several secondary metabolites, especially in the methanolic rootbark extract (MRBE). In addition, the MRBE had the highest TPC (76.7 mg GAE/g extracts), TFC (86.89 mg QE/g extracts), and TAC (80.68 mg ATE/g extracts) as compared to petroleum ether and chloroform extracts. Consistent with its TPC, TFC, and TAC, the MRBE demonstrated better antioxidant activity against DPPH radical scavenging (IC50 = 44.53 ppm) and FRAP assays (EC50 = 42.72 ppm). Moreover, all the rootbark extracts induced dose-dependent antibacterial activity against Streptococci pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Conclusions: The preliminary findings suggested the presence of a strong correlation between the folkloric use of P. confertiflorum and its observed antioxidant and antibacterial activity.

These plants are typically applied topically, potentially affecting both pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Gardnerella vaginalis) and beneficial vaginal microbes (Lactobacillus spp.). However, few studies have examined the impact of these plants on both beneficial and pathogenic vaginal bacteria. Aim of the study: Argemone mexicana, available in New York City and commonly used to treat gynecological infections by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, was investigated for its chemical variation and effects on the vaginal microbiota. We hypothesized that variations in the bioactivity of Argemone mexicana on Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus spp. are due to differences in antimicrobial compounds across different preparations. Materials and methods: Untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis using UPLC-qToF-MS and UPLC-TQD-MS were conducted on Argemone mexicana samples collected in New York City. Antimicrobial assays were used to assess the effects of Argemone mexicana samples on beneficial and pathogenic vaginal bacteria. ProGenesis QI and EZinfo were used for metabolomic analysis to link bioactivity with chemometric data. Results: UPLC-qToF-MS and statistical analyses showed that chemical variation correlated with plant tissue type and processing (dry or fresh samples). These differences were evident in antimicrobial screenings, where active plant samples were antimicrobial against pathogenic bacteria only, with no effect on beneficial Lactobacillus. Known antimicrobial benzoquinone alkaloids, such as berberine, were partly responsible for the observed microbiological activity. Berberine exhibited similar inhibition patterns, reduced biofilm formation, and trended towards higher concentration in active samples. Conclusions: Extracts of Argemone mexicana, a plant used in Caribbean women's health, did not have an effect on beneficial vaginal microbes, but did inhibit pathogenic Gardnerella vaginalis. This antimicrobial activity correlated with the chemical variation of berberine and other related alkaloids across traditional preparations of Argemone mexicana. These results may be relevant for treating gynecological infections, not only with this plant, but other berberine-containing taxa.",JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,Argemone mexicana; Papaveraceae; Berberine; Ethnobotany; Women's health,BERBERIS-VULGARIS; ALKALOIDS; HEALTH; WOMEN,"[Vardeman, Ella T.; Vandebroek, Ina] Ctr Plants People & Culture, New York Bot Garden, 2900 Southern Blvd, Bronx, NY 10458 United States of America; [Vardeman, Ella T.; Cheng, Hai-Ping; Vandebroek, Ina; Kennelly, Edward J.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Ph D Program Biol, 365 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016 United States of America; [Vardeman, Ella T.; Cheng, Hai-Ping; Kennelly, Edward J.] CUNY, Lehman Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd, Bronx, NY 10468 United States of America; [Vandebroek, Ina] Univ West Indies Mona, Caribbean Ctr Res Biosci CCRIB, Kingston, Jamaica",Argemone mexicana,,Papaveraceae,,"alkaloids, noise, anthraquinones","alkaloids, noise, anthraquinones",Gardnerella vaginalis,negative,,Argemone mexicana,Papaveraceae,Argemone,United States

C. cajan seeds contain highly diverse secondary metabolites with enriched beneficial properties, such as antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities. However, the antibacterial activities of secondary metabolites from Philippine-grown C. cajan, against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have not been thoroughly described. Here, we investigated the in vitro antibacterial properties of C. cajan seed against multidrug-resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 (MDRSA) and three other S. aureus strains (S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 6538, and coagulase-negative S. aureus) and, subsequently, identified the antibiotic markers against S. aureus strains using mass spectrometry. Secondary metabolites from C. cajan seeds were extracted using acetone, methanol, or 95% ethanol. Antibacterial screening revealed antibiotic activity for the C. cajan acetone extract. Bioassay-guided purification of the C. cajan acetone extract afforded three semi-pure high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractions exhibiting 32-64 mu g/mL minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against MDRSA. Chemical profiling of these fractions using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) identified six compounds that are antibacterial against MDRSA. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), MS/MS, and dereplication using Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS)(TM), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Library identified the metabolites as rhein, formononetin, laccaic acid D, crotafuran E, ayamenin A, and biochanin A.

(C. calcitrapa) aerial flowering parts, they were assessed in vitro. Using a spectrophotometer, the sample absorbance at 517 nm was used to quantify the scavenging activity. The negative control was DPPH. In the current study, the diffusion using agar wells technique was adapted to measure antimicrobial activity. Phytochemical analysis was performed using the recommended standard procedures. The methanol extract of C. calcitrapa exhibited high levels of total phenolic acids expressed as gallic acid (GA), measured as (97.25 +/- 0.73 mg GAE/g) content compared to the chloroform, acetyl acetate, and aqueous extracts (27.42 +/- 0.29, 64.25 +/- 0.96, and 17.25 +/- 0.73 mg GAE/g), respectively. Additionally, the methanol extract had a higher total tannin (27.52 +/- 0.53 mg TAE/g) content compared to the chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts (12.02 +/- 0.55, 26.01 +/- 0.81, and 7.35 +/- 0.56 mg TAE/g), respectively, while the aqueous extract contains a lower percentage of flavonoids (141.10 +/- 1.31 mg RTE/g) compared to the higher content achieved by the methanol extract (425.93 +/- 1.27 mg RTE/g). The hydroxyl groups of the flavonoid and the phenolic compounds found in C. calcitrapa are essentially scavenging free radicals. Radical scavenging activity was highest in the methanol extract (IC50 = 2.82 mu g/mL), aqueous extract (IC50 = 8.03 mu g/mL), ethyl acetate extract (IC50 = 4.79 mu g/mL), and chloroform extract (IC50 = 6.33 mu g/mL), as compared to the standard scavenging activity (IC50 = 2.52 mu g/mL). The antibacterial properties of C. calcitrapa against Gram-negative bacterial strains Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Acinetobacter baumanii, in addition to Gram-positive strains Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, revealed inhibition zone diameter. The findings of this investigation establish that the aerial flowering parts of C. calcitrapa have substantial antibacterial action against human infections, and the plant can serve as a significant antioxidant that can be employed to prevent and treat severe degenerative diseases brought on by oxidative stress. qPCR showed that C. calcitrapa extracts elevate both SOD1 and SOD2 (cellular oxidation markers) with remarkable folds (1.8-fold for SOD1 and SOD2) with ethyl acetate plant extract against ascorbic acid as a control.

HPLC analysis allowed the identification of two flavonoids (naringenin and quercetin), three phenolic acids (sinapic, ferulic and p-coumaric) and vanillin. It was found that the highest abundance in polyphenol, flavonoid and flavonol contents and also the strongest antioxidant activities were recorded in the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions with IC50 for DPPH assay of 30 +/- 1.4 mu g/mL, EC50 for FRAP assay of 24 +/- 1.1 mu g/mL and a reductive activity on phosphomolybdate of 134.79 +/- 1.8 mu g AAE/mg. The extracts showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities for the most tested microorganisms with inhibition zones ranging from 7 to 10 mm and MIC values ranging from 3.125 to 25 mg/mL. The most interesting activities were attributed to the ethyl acetate fractions notably against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii and Micrococcus luteus.

Peels represent between 50 to 65 % of total weight of the fruits and remain as the primary byproduct. Orange and pineapple fruits are majorly used for juice extraction in industrial leads to cause huge amounts of residues. If these residues are not processed further, it becomes waste and produce serious environmental pollution. The present study was aimed to extract the metabolites from waste peels, using ethanol and methanol solvent system and checked for the presence of various biomolecules and secondary metabolites like carbohydrates, proteins, steroid, lavonoid, alkaloids, tannins, saponines and tritepinoids. The ethanol solvent was showing most of the positive test as compared to methanol solvent in both the samples. Further, the antimicrobial properties of orange and pineapple peels were checked against pathogenic bacterial strains. The antimicrobial activity was performed, using agar well diffusion method against pathogenic bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumonia K2044, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC4676, Bacillus subtillis Py79 and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum LMG859). From the results, it was clearly observed that both orange and pineapple peel sample dissolved in ethanol, showing maximum zone of inhibition, against all the test pathogens. Methanol extract of both the samples, showing lower zone of inhibition in all the test pathogen as compared to ethanol extract samples. When both the samples, ethanol and methanol extracts were combined in equal amount and test against the pathogenic bacteria, they were showing maximum or equal zone of inhibition as the individual samples zone of inhibition. Finally, we can conclude that orange and pineapple fruits can be used as a antimicrobial agents for the protection from selected plant and animal pathogens, but the use of a standard method for investigation is essential.

In this study, preliminary phytochemical screening for C. papaya flowers was carried out using different methods as TLC screening and UV-spectroscopy along with evaluation of antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Methods were also developed for TLC and UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of the extracts.ResultsResults of phytochemical screening revealed that the methanol extract contains alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins as major components. Saponins and tannins were present in chloroform and n-hexane extracts; however, steroids and flavonoids were additionally found in n-hexane extract. Flavonoids, saponins, and tannins were present in aqueous extract of papaya flower. TLC and UV-visible spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of phenolics and flavonoids in different plant extracts. The total phenolic content (0.76 0.04 mg GAE/g dry weight) and total flavonoid content (1.53 0.10 mg QE/g dry weight) were the highest in the n-hexane extract of the flower. Antioxidant activity using DPPH free radical scavenging assay was the highest in n-hexane extract (64.07%). Antibacterial screening was carried out using well diffusion method against two pathogens Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The antibacterial assays of the extracts displayed the highest activity in methanolic extract against both E. coli (4.00 0.08) and B. subtilis (01.00 +/- 0.05).Conclusion This is the first report for the presence of alkaloids and saponins in C. papaya flowers. Also, it is the first report for determination of total phenolics and total flavonoids in C. papaya flowers. Methanolic extract displayed considerable antibacterial activity against E. coli and B. subtilis. The antioxidant and antibacterial properties of phytochemical extracts make them attractive alternative complementary medicines. More chemical investigation for chemical constituents is important for further drug development programs.Graphical abstract",BENI-SUEF UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES,SPRINGERNATURE,Antibacterial activity; Antioxidant activity; Carica papaya flower; Phytochemical analysis; Well diffusion; Total phenolic content,PLANTS; FLAVONOIDS; EXTRACT; TANNINS; PHENOLICS; SAPONINS; ACIDS,"[Dwivedi, Manish Kumar; Sonter, Shruti; Mishra, Shringika; Singh, Prashant Kumar] Indira Gandhi Natl Tribal Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Amarkantak 484887, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Patel, Digvesh Kumar] Indira Gandhi Natl Tribal Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Amarkantak 484887, Madhya Pradesh, India",Carica papaya,,Caricaceae,,"phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, flavonoids","phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, flavonoids","Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Carica papaya,Caricaceae,Carica,India

Phytochemical analysis was done by spectroscopic methods to investigate the amount of total polyphenols, and biological evaluation was done by the different antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory (tyrosinase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase), thrombolytic, and antibacterial activities. The highest amount of total phenolic and flavonoid contents was observed in methanolic extract (240.69 +/- 2.94 mg GAE/g and 167.59 +/- 3.47 mg QE/g); the fractions showed comparatively less quantity (57.02 +/- 1.31 to 144.02 +/- 2.11 mg GAE/g, and 48.21 +/- 0.75 to 96.58 +/- 2.30 mg QE/g). The effect of these bioactive contents was also related to biological activities. GCMS analysis led to the identification of bioactive compounds with different biological effects from methanolic extract (antioxidant; 55.07%, antimicrobial; 56.41%), while the identified compounds from the n-hexane fraction with antioxidant properties constituted 67.86%, and those with antimicrobial effects constituted 82.95%; however, the synergetic effect of polyphenols may also have contributed to the highest value of biological activities of methanolic extract. Molecular docking was also performed to understand the relationship of identified secondary metabolites with enzyme-inhibitory activities. The thrombolytic activity was also significant (40.18 +/- 1.80 to 57.15 +/- 1.10 % clot lysis) in comparison with streptokinase (78.5 +/- 1.53 to 82.34 +/- 1.25% clot lysis). Methanolic extract also showed good activity against Gram-positive strains of bacteria, and the highest activity was observed against Bacillus subtilis.

Syrah grape pomace extract","Grape pomace (GP) is a major byproduct worldwide, and it is well known for its bioactive compounds, such as fibers and phenolic compounds, that are popular for their impact upon human health, including gastrointestinal health. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition and biological activities of an enzymatic GP extract, as well as to investigate how gastrointestinal digestion (GID) modulates these properties. GP extract was previously produced using an enzymatic cocktail with xylanase activity and was then exposed to simulated conditions of GID, characterized for its chemical composition, and screened for antimicrobial, prebiotic, and antioxidant activities. The safety of this ingredient after GID was also assessed. GP extract presented high contents of dietary fiber and other carbohydrates, including xylooligosaccharides, in addition to minerals and phenolic compounds. In vitro simulated GID revealed that xylobiose was resistant to gastric conditions, unlike phenolic compounds. The use of 2% (w/v) of this ingredient proved to be a potential carbon source that could be fermented by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp, even after digestion. The extract also exhibited strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, after GID, the antioxidant capacity decreased, and the antimicrobial capacity was strongly reduced or lost. Furthermore, the extract safety was also guaranteed on Caco-2 intestinal cells. This novel and green GP extract proved to be composed of relevant bioactive molecules, including xylooligosaccharides, polyphenols, organic acids, and minerals, which provided different biological properties; it has potential applications in the food industry such that it can be used as an ingredient in the development of new functional foods.",FOOD & FUNCTION,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,,TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; DIETARY FIBER; MARC; XYLOOLIGOSACCHARIDES; TEMPERATURE; SEED; BIOACCESSIBILITY; POLYSACCHARIDE; ANTIBACTERIAL,"[Costa, Joana R.; Amorim, Manuela; Vilas-Boas, Ana; Pintado, Manuela] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Lab Associado, CBQF, Escola Super Biotecnol, Rua Arquiteto Lobao Vital 172, P-4200374 Porto, Portugal; [Tonon, Renata V.; Cabral, Lourdes M.

The aim of this research was to screen the phytochemical compounds and investigate the potency of Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe rhizome (CZR) extracts to inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of some pathogenic bacteria. Methodology and results: Antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of CZR extracts in different solvents were examined by agar well diffusion and the broth microdilution method after phytochemical screening. The 95% ethanolic extract of CZR exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial properties against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with inhibition zones of 7.25 +/- 0.58-12.00 +/- 0.26 mm and MIC values ranging from 50-200 mg/mL. The extract also showed rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities towards Enterococcus faecalis DMST 4736 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by time-kill assays. Moreover, the 95% ethanolic extracts of CZR also acted as a potent anti-biofilm agent against E. faecalis DMST 4736, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Proteus mirabilis DMST 8212 (54.62 +/- 0.30-71.25 +/- 0.20% inhibition of biofilm formation). The bioactive potency of compounds of the crude 95% ethanolic extract (tannins, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, terpenoids and alkaloids) play important roles in the observed antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities.

This work is aimed at studying the chemical composition (pigments, phenolics, volatile compounds) and biological activities (antioxidant and antimicrobial properties) of young and mature leaves of five eggplant cultivars (Solanum melongena L.) grown in Tunisia (Tizona, A1014, Nawel, A336, and Mirval). Pigment analysis showed no statistical variations between the two types of leaves, whereas higher levels of anthocyanins were recorded in young leaves of three out of five cultivars (24.7-52.8 mg 100 g(-1)). Total phenolic compounds (966.5-2072.6 mg 100 g(-1)) and o-diphenols (343.9-741.2 mg 100 g(-1)) contents varied significantly according to leaf age and cultivar. However, no statistically significant variation between young and mature leaves was found in flavonols and tannins content. As for volatile profiles, 62 constituents were characterized with non-terpene derivatives (52.0-61.6 %) and apocarotenes (19.9-35.6 %) as major chemical classes. Regarding the antioxidant activity, methanol extracts of Tizona cultivar mature leaves displayed important antiradical properties using DPPH, ABTS, and phosphomolybdenum assays (IC50 0.1, 0.2 and 0.01 mg mL(-1), respectively). With regards to reducing power determination, the most active extract was obtained from mature A1014 leaves. Further, young Mirval leaves proved to be significantly active from a bactericidal point of view against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus of 3.1 mg mL(-1) and 0.2 mg mL(-1) MBC, respectively.

The plants of the first harvest were used for the plant growth measurements (fresh weight and moisture content of leaves, rosette diameter, number and thickness of leaves), whereas those of the second harvest were not used for these measurements due to the flowering initiation, which made the leaves unmarketable due to their hard texture. The results of our study showed that C. raphanina subsp. mixta plants can be cultivated under mild salinity (S1 treatment) conditions without severe effects on plant growth and yield, since a more severe loss (27.5%) was observed for the S2 treatment. In addition, harvest time proved to be a cost-effective cultivation practice that allows to regulate the quality of the final product, either in edible form (first harvest) or for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical purposes as well as antimicrobial agents in food products. Therefore, the combination of these two agronomic factors showed interesting results in terms of the quality of the final product. In particular, high salinity (S2 treatment) improved the nutritional value by increasing the fat, proteins and carbohydrates contents in the first harvest, as well as the tocopherols and sugars contents (S1 and S2 treatments, respectively) in the second harvest. In addition, salinity and harvest time affected the oxalic acid content which was the lowest for the S2 treatment at the second harvest. Similarly, the richest fatty acid (alpha-linolenic acid) increased with increasing salinity at the first harvest. Salinity and harvest time also affected the antimicrobial properties, especially against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Trichoderma viride, where the extracts from the S1 and S2 treatments showed high effectiveness. In contrast, the highest amounts of flavanones (pinocembrin derivatives) were detected in the control treatment (second harvest), which was also reflected to the highest antioxidant activity (TBARS) for the same treatment. In conclusion, C. raphanina subsp. mixta plants seem to be tolerant to medium salinity stress (S1 treatment) since plant growth was not severely impaired, while salinity and harvesting time affected the nutritional value (fat, proteins, and carbohydrates) and the chemical composition (tocopherols, sugars, oxalic acid, fatty acids), as well as the bioactive properties (cytotoxicity and antimicrobial properties) of the final product.",MOLECULES,MDPI,abiotic stress; antimicrobial properties; antioxidants; cytotoxicity; flavanones; oxalic acid; polyphenols; pinocembrin; saline conditions,FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; PORTULACA-OLERACEA L.; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; SESQUITERPENE LACTONES; SECONDARY METABOLITES; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION; PHENOLIC PROFILE; COMMON PURSLANE; ESSENTIAL OILS,"[Petropoulos, Spyridon A.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytokou St, N Ionia 38446, Magnissia, Greece; [Fernandes, Angela; Dias, Maria Ines; Pereira, Carla; Calhelha, Ricardo C.; Barros, Lillian; Ferreira, Isabel C.

Chemical characterization of active extracts was carried out including free and fixed fatty acid analysis. Comparison of antimicrobial activity showed that N. arvensis chloroform extract was the most potent among all species tested, inhibiting Gram-positive bacterial and yeast strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL. With the exception of selective inhibitory action of n-hexane extract of N. orientalis on growth of Bacteroides fragilis (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL), we observed no antimicrobial activity for other Nigella species. Anti-inflammatory screening revealed that N. sativa, N. orientalis, N. hispanica, N. arvensis n-hexane, and N. hispanica chloroform extracts had strong inhibitory activity (more than 80%) on COX-1 and N. orientalis, N. arvensis, and N. hispanica n-hexane extracts were most effective against COX-2, when the concentration of extracts was 100 mu g/mL in both COX assays.

Seeds","The aim of this research was to identify and quantify biologically active compounds from avocado (Persea americana L.) seeds (AS) utilizing different techniques with the use of ultrasound (US), ethanol (EtOH), and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) for possible applications in (bio)medicine, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or other relevant industries. Initially, a study of the process efficiency (eta) was carried out, which revealed yields in the range of 2.96-12.11 wt%. The sample obtained using scCO(2) was found to be the richest in total phenols (TPC) and total proteins (PC), while the sample obtained with the use of EtOH resulted in the highest content of proanthocyanidins (PAC). Phytochemical screening of AS samples, quantified by the HPLC method, indicated the presence of 14 specific phenolic compounds. In addition, the activity of the selected enzymes (cellulase, lipase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, protease, transglutaminase, and superoxide dismutase) was quantified for the first time in the samples from AS. Using DPPH radical scavenging activity, the highest antioxidant potential (67.49%) was detected in the sample obtained with EtOH. The antimicrobial activity was studied using disc diffusion method against 15 microorganisms. Additionally, for the first time, the antimicrobial effectiveness of AS extract was quantified by determination of microbial growth-inhibition rates (MGIRs) at different concentrations of AS extract against three strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) bacteria, three strains of Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria, and fungi (Candida albicans). MGIRs and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values were determined after 8 and 24 h of incubation, thus enabling the screening of antimicrobial efficacy for possible further applications of AS extracts as antimicrobial agents in (bio)medicine, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or other industries. For example, the lowest MIC90 value was determined for B. cereus after 8 h of incubation in the case of UE and SFE extracts (70 mu g/mL), indicating an outstanding result and the potential of AS extracts, as the MIC values for B. cereus have not been investigated so far.",PLANTS-BASEL,MDPI,avocado seed; Persea americana; HPLC; phenolic compounds; enzymatic activity; phytochemistry; antioxidant; antimicrobial activity,ULTRASOUND-ASSISTED EXTRACTION; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; DERIVATIVES; ACID; OPTIMIZATION; POLYPHENOLS; COUMARIN; PLANTS; PEELS,"[Kupnik, Kaja; Primozic, Mateja; Knez, Zeljko; Leitgeb, Maja] Univ Maribor, Fac Chem & Chem Engn, Smetanova Ulica 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Kupnik, Kaja; Kokol, Vanja] Univ Maribor, Fac Mech Engn, Smetanova Ulica 17, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Knez, Zeljko; Leitgeb, Maja] Univ Maribor, Fac Med, Taborska Ulica 8, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",Persea americana,,Lauraceae,,"phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics, phenolics","phenolics, flavonoids, phenolics, phenolics","Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa","positive, positive, positive, negative, negative",Candida albicans,Persea americana,Lauraceae,Persea,Slovenia

The effects of the supercritical extraction conditions on the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the extracts obtained were evaluated and compared with essential oil of ginger obtained from hydrodistillation technique. The extractions using CO2 were performed in a laboratory scale unit at pressures of 10.0 MPa, 17.5 MPa and 25.0 MPa and at 293.15 K, 313.15 K and 333.15 K. The operating conditions tested achieved a maximum yield of 2.62 wt% for the CO2 extraction and 1.79 wt% for the hydrodistillation. When CO2 was used as the solvent, the pressure and temperature had a significant effect on the extraction yield. The chemical profiles determined by gas chromatography were found to be similar for the two methods; however, the quantities of the compounds extracted were different. The main compounds present in the extracts obtained using CO2 were alpha-zingiberene, beta-sesquiphellandrene, alpha-farnesene, geranial, beta-bisabolene and beta-eudesmol. For the oil obtained by hydrodistillation, alpha-curcumene, geranial and camphene were the most abundant compounds. Antibacterial activity assays were performed on the ginger extracts and essential oil using the agar well method. The extracts obtained using supercritical CO2 presented antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria. The oil obtained by hydrodistillation differed from the other samples tested and had a lower capacity for inhibition of Pseudomonas aeroginosa bacteria than the supercritical extract. For the Gram-negative bacterias Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri the oil showed slight inhibition.

Even though synthetic fungicides are an efficient control method, several negative side effects emerge from their extensive use, such as health problems, environmental pollution, and the emergence of resistant microorganisms. Thus, it is becoming more and more urgent to search for alternative control methods.Aim of the study: The aim of our study was to analyze phytochemical composition and antifungal potential of Launaea mucronata (Forssk.) Muschl. and Launaea nudicaulis (L.) Hook. fil. wildly growing in Anbar province, Iraq. In addition, molecular analysis was used to identify the plants species and molecular docking analysis was investigated between the major phytochemicals present in these plants and three selected fungal proteins, in order to assess the antifungal activity of the selected biochemicals against these proteins.Materials and methods: Molecular analysis was performed using ITS sequencing protocol. The phytochemical analysis was done using GC-MS technique, while molecular docking analysis was performed by FRED application between selected compounds from each plant and three enzymes: 17 & beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, endochitinase, and 14-& alpha;-demethylase. Finally, the antifungal activity was assessed by measuring inhibition percentage of Fusarium solani and Macrophomina phaseolina growth treated with ethanomethanolic extract of each plant.Results: Molecular analysis identified the selected plants as L. mucronata and L. nudicaulis, with an ITS region of 600 bp. Phytochemical analysis of Launaea spp. reported the presence of 35 compounds in each ethanomethanolic extract, belonging to different classes. L. mucronata was mainly formed of lupeol (9.33%), whereas L. nudicaulis extract was dominated by the heterocyclic compound 4-(3-methoxyphenoxy)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-amine (20.2%). Furthermore, molecular docking analysis showed that 4H-pyran-4-one,2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6methyl from L. mucronata and gulonic acid Ƴ-lactone from L. nudicaulis possessed the highest affinity score to 17-& beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (-4.584 and -7.811 kcal/mol, respectively). Sucrose from L. mucronata and glutaric acid, di(3,4-difluorobenzyl) ester from L. nudicaulis gave the highest affinity to endochitinase (-7.979 and - 8.446 kcal/mol, respectively). In addition, sterol 14-& alpha;-demethylase was affinitive to sucrose from L. mucronata and glutaric acid, di(3,4-difluorobenzyl) ester from L. nudicaulis via energetic score of -10.002 and -9.582 kcal/mol, respectively.

Machilus bombycina (som), Litsea polyantha (sualu), Litsea salicifolia (dighloti) and Litsea citrata (mejankari). The methanolic extracts of leaves of these plants were screened for their phytochemical analysis and free radical scavenging activity using 2,2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl as the free radical. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, saponins, coumarins, terpenoids, tanins, cardiac glucosides and xanthoproteins in the said plants. The results of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity revealed Litsea polyantha to exhibit stronger antioxidant efficiency compared to the rest. Besides these, the plant extracts were investigated for their antibacterial assessment against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis and Gram-negative Pasteurella multocida and Escherichia coli bacteria found in pig. All the plant extracts were validated to possess antibacterial activity with variable potency. Litsea citrata was the most effective extract retarding microbial growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, followed by Litsea salicifolia, Litsea polyantha and Machilus bombycina.

It is widely spread in Saudi Arabia and other countries in Southwest Asia. O. baccatus is extensively used in traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent, in addition to being a vital source of food for certain desert animal species. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial/anticancer activities of O. baccatus methanolic extracts collected from Hail, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: The O. baccatus extracts were obtained by macerating the crude powder in methanol, followed by filtration and evaporation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze the methanolic extracts' chemical constituents. Broth microdilution assay for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was used to assess antimicrobial activity, while the extracts' anticancer potential was assessed by sulforhodamine B Assay (SRB) assay. Results: The results of the antibacterial assay showed that the methanolic extracts from the roots and branches possessed varying degrees of activity against particular bacterial strains, with the highest activity being exerted by the branches' extract against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (St), demonstrating MIC values of 15.6 mu g/mL and 20 mu g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the SRB cell viability assay revealed that only the branches' extract inhibited the growth of A549 cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 86.19 mu g/mL.

Several stud-ies have attempted to isolate useful compounds from various parts of this plant. However, the phytochemical constituents of C. inophyllum flower have not been extensively studied. This pioneering study focused on the chemical composition of C. inophyllum flower analyzed by gas chromatography-electron ionization/mass spectrometry (GC-EI/MS) and the antibacterial effects of C. inophyllum flower extracted with organic solvents. Phytochemical compounds were obtained from C. inophyllum flower via maceration with sequential extrac-tion using hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol, respectively. Phytochemical components of total phenolic (TP), total flavonoid (TF), and total saponin (TSC) contents were determined by colorimetric methods and each extract was found to be rich in phenolic, flavonoid, and saponin constituents. The antibacterial activities of the extracts were studied by disk diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) assays were used to address the potentials of extracts. All extracts were active against pathogenic bacteria at different concentrations, and were especially active against Salmo-nella tyhpi. In addition, the hexane extract exhibited the lowest MIC and MBC of 0.098 and 3.12 mg/mL, respectively, against B. cereus based on the antibacterial dilution method. The correlation analysis indicated a negative relationship between the flavonoid content and the inhibition zone of Salmonella typhi, with a sig-nificant value of p < 0.05. On the contrary, a positive relationship between the saponin content and the inhi-bition zone Klebsiella pneumoniae. These results showed that C. inophyllum flower extracts are rich of bioactive compounds such as phytol, eugenol, caryophyllene oxide, a-copaene, a-muurolene, b-caryophyllene, b-amysin, farnesol, palmitic acid, and cadinene derivatives.(c) 2023 SAAB.

Role of endogenous factors in the selection of the best plant extracts,"Phenolic contents were determined in S. kali leaves, stems, and roots at the beginning, the mid and the end of the vegetative period, as well as the floral bud and open flower at the reproductive stage. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were also assessed. Moreover, the major metabolites were identified by HPLC. Results showed a maximum of total phenol contents in the photosynthetic organs, followed by stems and roots. A similar tendency was found for the flavonoids and condensed tannins. Concerning antioxidant analysis, antiradical and Fe-reduced activities were higher in leaves and stems whereas Fe-chelating activity was higher in leaves and roots. Independently of the plant organ, total phenol and flavonoid contents were maximal at the end of the vegetative period whereas tannin content was maximal at the reproductive one. Phenolic contents were related to the organ, the development stage, and their interaction. Concerning the antimicrobial activity, stem extracts were the most efficient against human pathogen strains (Bacteria: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fungi: Candida kefyr, C. holmii, C. albicans, C. sake and C. glabrata). Moreover, nine natural products were identified in leaf and stem extracts of S. kali known for their biological activities. As a whole, biological activities of S. kali seem to be strongly related to organs and to the development stage. The phytochemical tests by HPLC demonstrated the presence of nine compounds among them two alkaloids: salsoline and fraxidin. Some molecules are presented in both organs (salsoline, resorcinol, luteolin 7-o-glucoside; and hyperoside). Therefore, endogenous factors greatly account for the biological potential of this medicinal halophyte. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Results: The chemical profile of leaf essential oil of P. marginatum underwent alterations when infested with the grasshopper Xyleus discoideus. The antimicrobial activity of leaf essential oil infested by grasshopper decreased against the microorganisms Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and oil was inactive against the fungus Malassezia furfur. Additionally, the essential oil obtained of P. marginatum leaves subjected to the mechanical damage showed chemical change compared to the oil from the intact leaves but did not cause alterations in the antimicrobial activity of oil. Conclusion: The overall results of this study reveal that P. marginatum leaves respond very clearly to the damages caused by attack by the grasshopper X. discoideus and mechanical damage.",NATURAL PRODUCTS JOURNAL,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL,Plant stress; herbivory; Piper marginatum; antimicrobial; Xyleus discoideus,INDUCED PLANT VOLATILES; VARIABILITY; DEFENSE; JACQ,"[da Silva, Adson S.; Ramos, Clecio S.] Rural Fed Univ Pernambuco, Dept Chem, Recife, PE, Brazil; [da Silva, Janete M.] Rural Fed Univ Pernambuco, Antibiot Dept, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Almeida, Argus V.] Rural Fed Univ Pernambuco, Dept Biol, Recife, PE, Brazil",Piper marginatum,,Piperaceae,,"noise, noise","noise, noise",Bacillus subtilis,positive,Malassezia furfur,Piper marginatum,Piperaceae,Piper,Brazil

The disease is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (predominantly in immunocompromised individuals) and by Cryptococcus gattii. Globally the disease is estimated to cause around 600,000 deaths annually. Antifungal therapy is available, but in the developing world, may be unaffordable to many people, there is an increasing threat of resistance to the available drugs and our repertoire of antifungal drugs is very limited. Consequently, more research has been focusing on the use of medicinal plants as therapeutic agents. The originality of the current study is that although Tulbaghia violacea is a well-documented medicinal plant, the chemical composition of aqueous extracts and their antifungal potential against pathogenic yeasts are unknown. This is the first study that evaluates the chemical constituents of aqueous T. violacea root, leaf, rhizome and tuber extracts and their corresponding antifungal activities against C. neoformans and C. gattii. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the phytochemical composition and antifungal potential of Tulbaghia violacea root, leaf, rhizome and tuber extracts against Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Methods: Roots, leaves, rhizomes and tubers were extracted with water only for 48 h at room temperature with continuous shaking. Extracts were filter sterilized, freeze-dried and, chemically analyzed for saponin, flavonol, phenolic and tannin content. Chemical constituents of each extract were also identified by GC-MS analysis. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of suitably diluted extracts of each plant part were also performed against C. neoformans and C. gattii, yeast pathogens commonly associated with HIV/AIDS sufferers. Results: Phytochemical analysis showed different concentrations of saponins (between 1023 and 2896.73 mu g/ml), phenolics (between 16.48 and 51.58 mu g/ml) and tannins (between 122.30 and 543.07 mu g/ml) present in the different extracts. No flavonols were detected. GC-MS analysis identified a complex mixture of phytochemicals composed predominantly of sulphide, pyran, furan and ketone containing compounds to be present in the different plant parts. All extracts were dominated by the presence of 4 H-pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl, a pyran known to have antifungal properties. Although the root, leaf, rhizome and tuber extracts exhibited antifungal activities against both fungi, the rhizome and tuber extract were found to possess the lowest MIC's of 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml against Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii respectively. Conclusion: T. violacea extracts have a complex constituent of phytochemicals and each plant part exhibited a strong antifungal activity against C. neoformans and C. gattii. The rhizome and tuber extracts showed the highest antifungal activity against C. neoformans and C. gattii respectively. Thus, T. violacea aqueous extracts are strong candidates for further development into an antifungal chemotherapeutic agent.",NATURAL PRODUCTS JOURNAL,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL,Cryptococcus neoformans; Cryptococcus gattii; phytochemical analysis; antifungal; 4 H pyran-4-one DDMP; chemotherapeutic agent,CELL-WALL; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; CANDIDA; TANNINS; SAPONIN; GROWTH,"[Pattoo, Mitradev; Belewa, Vuyokazi; Somai, Benesh Munilal] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Tulbaghia violacea,,Amaryllidaceae,,"phenolics, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, saponins","phenolics, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, saponins",,,"Cryptococcus gattii, Cryptococcus neoformans",Tulbaghia violacea,Amaryllidaceae,Tulbaghia,South Africa

Through optimized protocols, we obtained fractions of the initial ethanolic extracts rich in most important bioactive compounds from R. rosea, including salidroside, rosavins, proanthocyanidins (PACs), and flavonoids. The antimicrobial activity in relation to the chemical composition of the extracts and their fractions was studied with an emphasis on C. jejuni AI-2-mediated intercellular signaling. At concentration 15.625 mg/L, bioluminescence reduction rates varied from 27% to 72%, and the membrane remained intact. Fractions rich in PACs had the strongest antimicrobial effect against C. jejuni, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (M F3 40%: 62.5 mg/L; R F3 40%: 250 mg/L) and the highest intercellular signaling reduction rates (M F3 40%: 72%; R F3 40%: 65%). On the other hand, fractions without PACs were less effective (MICs: M F5 PVP: 250 mg/L; R F5 PVP: 1000 mg/L and bioluminescence reduction rates: M F5 PVP: 27%; R F5 PVP: 43%). Additionally, fractions rich in flavonoids had strong antimicrobial activity (MICs: M F4 70%: 125 mg/L; R F4 70%: 250 mg/L and bioluminescence reduction rates: M F4 70%: 68%; R F4 70%: 50%). We conclude that PACs and flavonoids are crucial compound groups responsible for the antimicrobial activity of R. rosea roots and rhizomes in C. jejuni.",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,MDPI,Rhodiola rosea; proanthocyanidins; flavonoids; Campylobacter jejuni; LuxS; intercellular signaling,BIOFILM FORMATION; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; QUORUM; L.; ANTIBACTERIAL; SALIDROSIDE; EXTRACTS; MOTILITY; ROSAVIN; LUXS,"[Kuncic, Ajda; Mozina, Sonja Smole] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Jamnikarjeva Ulica 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Bucar, Franz] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmacognosy, Beethovenstr 8, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Rhodiola rosea,,Crassulaceae,,"flavonoids, flavonoids","flavonoids, flavonoids",Campylobacter jejuni,negative,,Rhodiola rosea,Crassulaceae,Rhodiola,Slovenia

Hyperoside and isoquercetin (25.7 +/- 0.02 and 17.8 +/- 0.02 mu g/mg extract, respectively) were determined as the main compounds of the methanol extract. The major compounds of essential oil of HCC were found to be spathulenol and iso-longifolene (12.9% and 11.2%, respectively), and linoleic and palmitic acids (26.8% and 18.3%, respectively) were the main fatty acids. The methanol extract whose antioxidant activities studied for the first time was found to have moderate activity in beta-carotene bleaching method (IC50: 41.69 +/- 1.29 mu g/mL) and was found to be the most active extract in scavenging of DPPH free radical (IC50: 16.82 +/- 0.58 mu g/mL) and ABTS cation radical (IC50: 9.24 +/- 0.28 mu g/mL) and CUPRAC assays. Among the prepared four extracts of HCC, the methanol extract showed highest activity against Escherichia coli with an MIC value of 10 mu g/mL, and the methanol extract was also found to have high DNA damage protective activity. The methanol extract exhibited high butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (70.74%).

Purified ellagitannin compounds were analysed using High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Total phenolic content, total ellagitannin and antioxidant activity results showed that the bioactive compounds of purified ellagitannin were significantly higher than pomegranate peel extract. About 10 bioactive compounds were identified in LCMS. HPLC showed purified ellagitannin contains similar to 67% (w/w) of punicalagin. The results of the antimicrobial assay revealed that purified ellagitannin was more sensitive against Aspergillus tubigensis and Staphylococcus aureus as compared to Escherichia coli. In-vitro gastrointestinal stability exhibited that total ellagitannin was more stable as compared to phenolic compounds. The cytotoxic analysis confirmed that purified ellagitannin is non-toxic to normal (Vero) healthy cells. Further, thermo-gravimetric analysis was used to study the temperature profile of purified ellagitannin to predict its applicability in the food matrix.

Since it contains many new and known bioactive compounds, it has a great potential to be developed as value-added products in food, cosmetic, and medicinal industries. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the chemical profile and bioactivity (i.e. antibacterial and antioxidant activity) of dried, fresh, and frozen Chinese chives (A. tuberosum Rottl. ex Spreng) undergone 3 different solvent extraction conditions (i.e., 95% ethanol, hexane, oil extract). The result showed that different extraction conditions resulted in significantly different chemical profiles and bioactivities in both antibacterial and antioxidant activities (p < 0.05). An increase in extract concentration significantly increased its antibacterial activity. This finding implied that both extraction condition and extract concentration play an important role in antibacterial activity. Modified agar well diffusion method was used to evaluate antimicrobial activity against 6 pathogenic bacteria used in this study, including Escherichia coli ATCC25822, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium U302, S. enterica Enteritidis, S. enterica 4,5,12; i-human (US clone), Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes 10403S. The frozen Chinese chives crude hexane extract gave the highest antibacterial (0.50 +/- 0.03 to 0.29 +/- 0.03 cm) activity against all tested pathogens. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential assay was used to evaluate antioxidant activity of extracts. The results showed that the highest antioxidant activity was 1.76 +/- 0.01 mu mol Fe2+/ mg using frozen Chinese chives crude hexane extract. The different extraction conditions significantly affected antioxidant activity (p < 0.05). The antioxidant activity varied from 0.17 +/- 0.00 to 1.76 +/- 0.01 mu mol Fe2+/mg depending on the extraction condition. GC-MS results showed that two major chemical compounds in Chinese chives crude hexane extract are phenol and 3-Methyl-cyclopentanol.

The cytotoxicity was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). The antibacterial activity was assessed by minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration. Interactions between ligands and beta-lactamase were evaluated via molecular docking. UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS detected acacetin, apigenin, chrysoeriol, isorhamnetin, isorhamnetin isomer, kaempferide, 3 ',4 '-dimethoxyluteolin, 3,7-dimethoxy-5,3 ',4 '-trihydroxyflavone, piptocarphin A and glaucolide A. Vp-LRE (30 mu g/mL) and glaucolide A (10 and 20 mu g/mL) were cytotoxic against RAW 264.7 cells. Glaucolide A was not active, but Vp-LRE inhibited the Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Salmonella Choleraesuis and Typhimurium, with a bacteriostatic effect. The compounds (glaucolide A, 3 ',4 '-dimethoxyluteolin, acacetin and apigenin) were able to interact with beta-lactamase, mainly through hydrogen bonding, with free energy between -6.2 to -7.5 kcal/mol. These results indicate that V. polyanthes is a potential natural source of phytochemicals with a significant antibiotic effect against MRSA strains.",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,MDPI,Vernonia polyanthes; flavonoids; glaucolide A; UHPLC; Q-TOF-MS; antibacterial activity; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,SESQUITERPENE LACTONES; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; GLANDULAR TRICHOMES; CRUDE EXTRACTS; PLANTS; LEAVES; FLAVONOIDS; INHIBITORS; PRODUCTS,"[de Santana, Jordana Damasceno Gitirana; Santos-Mayorga, Oscar Alejandro; Florencio, Jonatas Rodrigues; de Oliveira, Mirella Chrispim Cerqueira; de Almeida, Luisa Maria Silveira; Xavier, Julianna Oliveira de Lucas] Univ Fed Juiz Fora, Programa Pos Grad Ciencias Farmaceut, Rua Jose Lourenco Kelmer S-N,Bairro Sao Pedro, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Zimmermann-Franco, Danielle Cristina; Macedo, Gilson Costa] Univ Fed Juiz Fora, Ctr Tecnol Celular & Imunol Aplicada IMUNOCET, Dept Parasitol, Rua Jose Lourenco Kelmer S-N,Campus Univ,, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Ferreira, Adriana Lucia Pires] Univ Fed Rio Janeiro, Hosp Univ Clementino Fraga Filho, Ilha Fundao, Rua Prof Rodolpho Paulo Rocco 255,, BR-21941913 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [de Sousa, Orlando Vieira; da Silva Filho, Ademar Alves; Alves, Maria Silvana] Univ Fed Juiz Fora, Fac Farm, Dept Ciencias Farmaceut, Rua Jose Lourenco Kelmer S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil",Vernonia polyanthes,,Asteraceae,,flavonoids,flavonoids,"Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli","positive, negative",,Vernonia polyanthes,Asteraceae,Vernonia,Brazil

Medicinal plants offer an eco-friendly and sustainable solution for managing diseases and pests in agricultural systems. These plants are rich in bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, fl avonoids, terpenoids, phenolics, and essential oils, many of which have proven antimicrobial, antifungal, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. These characteristics make medicinal plants viable candidates for postharvest disease and pest control. Among these, Larrea tridentata (creosote bush) is particularly notable for its bioactive compounds with strong antifungal properties. Their potential applications include agriculture, food preservation, and medicine. This study aimed to evaluate how different solvent mixtures affect the efficiency of ultrasound-assisted extraction, total polyphenol content, antioxidant capacity, and antifungal activity of L. tridentata leaves and stems. The fi ndings revealed that the 60% ethanol ultrasound-assisted extract of L. tridentata leaves (ULL 60%) contained the highest concentration of bioactive compounds, including hydrolysable tannins (690.2 mg GAE/100 g) and condensed tannins (329.9 mg CE/100 g). All extracts demonstrated notable antioxidant activity in ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays, with ethanol-based extracts showing greater antioxidant potential than their aqueous counterparts. In terms of antifungal efficacy, 100% ethanol leaf extract exhibited the strongest inhibition against Fusarium oxysporum (60.03%), whereas 50% ethanol extract effectively inhibited Alternaria alternata (53.61%). Six major polyphenolic compounds were identified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-ESI-MS). These include quercetin, luteolin, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, elenolic acid, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), and kaempferide. These compounds are known to have antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties. These fi ndings underscore the potent fungistatic properties of L. tridentata leaf extracts against key phytopathogenic fungi, highlighting their potential as bioactive agents in the formulation of eco-friendly biopesticides.",PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,Phytopathogens; bioactive compounds; desert plants; Fusarium oxysporum; Alternaria alternata,ACID,"[Bamidele, Muyideen Olaitan; Flores-Lopez, Maria Liliana; Gonzalez, Monica Lizeth Chavez; Aguilar, Cristobal Noe] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Sch Chem, Food Res Dept, Bioproc & Bioprod Res Grp, Saltillo 25070, Mexico; Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest Innovac Cientificaf & Tecnol, Saltillo 25070, Mexico",Larrea tridentata,,Zygophyllaceae,,"phenolics, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids, phenolics, phenylethanoids, phenolics, noise","phenolics, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids, phenolics, phenylethanoids, phenolics, noise",,,"Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata",Larrea tridentata,Zygophyllaceae,Larrea,Mexico

The use of plant extracts with biological properties appears as a viable and healthy alternative when compared to synthetic substances. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the aqueous extracts of native and cultivated leaves of Physalis angulata L., as well as the influence of the extraction method on the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity. The extracts were obtained from the native and cultivated leaves of P. angulata using three different extraction methods: decoction, maceration and an ultrasound-assisted method. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between the extraction methods and the type of plant material. The extracts obtained by decoction showed the highest levels of phenolic compounds and higher antioxidant potential for both analytical methods (ABTS and DPPH), differing significantly from the other extraction methods. The bioaccessibility indices of the phenolic compounds obtained from the extracts were considered reduced after the simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and consequently, showed low antioxidant potential. The antimicrobial potential of the extracts was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes.",REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA,"UNIV FEDERAL CEARA, DEPT GEOL",Antimicrobial potential; Antioxidant potential; Bioactive compounds,ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; POLYPHENOLS; CAPACITY,"[Braga Dias, Flayanna Gouveia; Gomes Ferreira, Maria Jaiana; Ribeiro da Silva, Larissa Morais; de Sousa Menezes, Rayanne Clecia; Teixeira de Figueiredo, Evania Altina] Univ Fed Ceara UFC, Programa Posgrad Ciencia & Tecnol Alimentos, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Physalis angulata,,Solanaceae,,phenolics,phenolics,"Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes","positive, positive",,Physalis angulata,Solanaceae,Physalis,Brazil
